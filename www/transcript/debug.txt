 Today is June 29th, 2008, and this is the oral history interview conducted with
Toshiko Akiyoshi in her house on 38 W. 94th Street in Manhattan, New York.
Good
afternoon, Toshiko-san!

2
Akiyoshi:
3
 Good afternoon!

4
Brown:
5
 At long last, Im so honored to be able to conduct this oral history interview with
you.
Its been about ten years since we last saw each other--we had a chance to talk at
the Monterey Jazz Festival--but this interview we want you to tell your life history, so
we want to start at the very beginning, starting (with) as much information as you can tell
us about your family.
First, if you can give us your birth name, your complete birth
name.

6
Akiyoshi:
7
 To-shi-ko.

8
Brown:
9
 Akiyoshi.

10
Akiyoshi:
11
 Just the way you pronounced.

12
Brown:
13
 Oh, okay (laughs).
So, Toshiko Akiyoshi.


14
Akiyoshi:
15
 Yes.

16
Brown:
17
 And does "Toshiko" mean anything special in Japanese?

18
Akiyoshi:
19
 Well, I think,...all names, as you know, Japanese names depends on the kanji
Chinese ideographs).
Different kanji means different (things), pronounce it the same
way.
And mine is "Toshiko," (which means) something like "sensitive," "susceptible,"
something to do with a dark sort of nature.
Most womens "Toshiko" is usually more
elegant, more woman-like, kinda, that kanji they usually use.
Mine isnt.
Whatever.
(laughs)

20
Brown:
21
 (Laughs) Okay.
Can you tell us your parents, both your names of your parents?
And where theyre originally from.

22
Akiyoshi:
23
 My fathers name is Katsur Akiyoshi.
My mothers maiden name is Hiraike,
so her name is Shigeko Hiraike.
And they were married, I dont know when, wherever,
laughs) and when I was born, Im the last of the four daughters.
Four daughters.

24
Akiyoshi:
25
 And, uh, my father had a job in old Manchuria, today its called Liaoning
province of China, in (a) Japanese cotton, textile, company.
And the time when I was in
sixth grade, my father became independent and he started his own company, more like a
trading company.

26
Brown:
27
 Can you tell me where your parents are from in Japan, before they migrated to
Manchuria?

28
Akiyoshi:
29
 Oh, they were both from Kysh, ita....

30
Brown:
31
 ita?

32
Akiyoshi:
33
 ...province.
And, uh ...
I dont know much about (it) except that.
(laughs)

34
Brown:
35
 (Chuckles).
Okay.
And can you give us your birth date?

36
Akiyoshi:
37
 First part?

38
Brown:
39
 Your birth date?

40
Akiyoshi:
41
 I was born in 1929, December 12th.


42
Brown:
43
 Twelfth.

44
Akiyoshi:
45
 Twelfth.
Twelve-twelve, very easy to remember.

46
Brown:
47
 Right.
And you were born, do you know exactly where in Manchuria?
I know
Dairen (Ch: Dalian) is whats recorded....

48
Akiyoshi:
49
 I was educated there, but I was born in a place called Ryy, Liaoyang--I
guess they maybe pronounce the Chinese way, probably called Liaoyang--where the big
Japanese cotton textile company was.
So....

50
Brown:
51
 So when you were living in China, um, Manchuria, or Dairen, did you live with
your sisters, so everyone grew up, you had the whole family there?

52
Akiyoshi:
53
 Well, whole family ... Liaoyang city, it didnt have high school, so all my
sisters, they, when they came to graduate (from) grammar school, they all went to Dairen,
where (there was) a junior high, high school.
So, thats what my mother wanted.
Most
children, I think, in Ryy went to the city called Anzan (Ch: nshn), which is about an
hour, not even quite (an) hour, maybe 40 minutes train ride, the next big city from
Ryy.
But my mother wanted them to be educated in Dairen, I guess its considered a
better school for their....

54
Brown:
55
 Now, was this a Japanese school...?

56
Akiyoshi:
57
 Yes.

58
Brown:
59
 ...and was there a large Japanese community?

60
Akiyoshi:
61
 They were all Japanese schools.
(Its) amazing the fact, you know, Im
thinking about when I went to high school in Dairen, there was ... in those days, (it was)
like a man and a woman (were) different; boys had a boys high school, girls had a girls
high school.
And the girl high school alone, (Dairen) had five of them.
And each school,
I would say, when I was in high school, classes were about 45 students.
And we had five
class(es), I mean five different, you know, classmates, like, say, Cherries class, and there
was an ume (plum) club, there was like a chrysanthemum class, things like that.

62
Brown:
63
 Based after, uh, flower names.

64
Akiyoshi:
65
 Yeah, so basically, youre looking at it, girls alone (were) approximately 240
students in one class, one, yeah, one, what do you call...and we had a high school that
takes four years.
So if you multiply that, basically you have about, a little over one
thousand children.
Now, this is only girls alone.
So, lets say the boys are approximately


the same number, maybe more or less.
So from that you kind of estimate how many
Japanese were in Dairen, you can imagine how big the population was.

66
Brown:
67
 And all instruction was in Japanese?

68
Akiyoshi:
69
 There was ...
I dont remember having a Chinese student.
I think if they
spoke Japanese, there probably could have been.
But obviously there werent (any).
So
without my knowing it, they were, like, separated.
You know, (in) much later years,
much later, I dont quite remember, it was over ten years ago, I was asked by NHK
television, which is like the BBC, to go back to where I was born and raised, they called
it) Trip to Where the Heart Belongs (Sekai waga kokoro no tabi, broadcast Oct. 17,
, something like that.
And it was a new television series, and I was the first one.
And I hadnt been there in fifty years at that time.
And that time I realized the fact that is,
we were segregated (from Chinese).
You know, I never thought about it that way.
And,
when I went there--see, you cant do this without having a Chinese part of cooperation,
and they had people who spoke Japanese fluently, and they are the ones who set up a
tour--and from morning til evening we had Chinese food.
And it tasted very, very
good, but there wasnt anything like a, no ocean fish, except with the governors official
dinner, or mayors official dinner.
Other than that, fish, every once and a while that
would be the river fish, freshwater fish.
And I realized that we were considered,
probably, a privileged class, and I thought they were probably looking at us like that.
I
didnt realize til then that Japan is ... one of the things that I was thinking about,
sometimes compared to, lets say, this country had a long history of prejudice to(ward)
anybody who had color, you know, the black people, or the yellow, whatever.
And the
old days, as you know, America had segregation, you cant ride on the same bus, what
have you.
But one thing about Manchuria, now China, their railroad was built by a
Japanese railroad company (South Manchurian Railway), but they were more advanced
than in Japan: the rails were wider, and also it didnt matter if they were Chinese or
American or Japanese--I guess there werent any Americans there, I dont know
laughs).
Maybe there were some, priests maybe.
But, if you had the money, you could
ride first class, second class, (??
) class, you know.
So there was no--as far as that is
concerned--there was no segregation as far as that is concerned.
I think thats, you
know, something.
I never sort of ... also, we were, it was mandatory to learn Chinese,
from the third grade.
Boy, its a hard language, Chinese!
(chuckles).

70
Brown:
71
 Do you remember any Chinese?

72
Akiyoshi:
73
 Oh yes, yes, but Ill tell you one thing: if I stayed in China for, maybe, one
month, without talking Japanese, you know, I think Id get (it) back.
I think I ... because
all together, three, four, five, six, then it was junior high, one, two, ... seven years of
Chinese.
When I was third year of high school that the war was going pretty bad, so in
fourth grade the war was ended.


74
Brown:
75
 When did you learn English?
Did you study English in school?

76
Akiyoshi:
77
 English was from high school, the very beginning of high school, and, uh, the
war started when I was (in) sixth grade, and about a year later, no, maybe two years later,
English was taken off from a mandatory class, and it was you could attend the class as a,
if you wanted.
So, it wasnt like a regular class, but you could apply for (it).
Which I
did, but I did terrible, I mean I was just....
Language wasnt (laughs) my forte.

78
Brown:
79
 So when you learned Chinese, of course, kanji is the big difference, and learning
all the kanji, so....

80
Akiyoshi:
81
 Kanji, yes, kanji, some (of them) mean the same, because, after all, it came
from China.
But most of them are different.
Some are the same meaning.
But it is a
really hard language, the pronunciation is hard (chuckles).

82
Brown:
83
 Tonal, as well.

84
Akiyoshi:
85
 Yeah, thats what I mean.
Its the same thing, but it depends on the tone ...

86
Brown:
87
 "N ho ma.
"

88
Akiyoshi:
89
 ... yeah, different meaning.
So its a very hard....

90
Brown:
91
 So you were talking earlier about the difference in the social strata.
So, you
were considered, your upbringing, your social class while you were in Manchuria, you
were very comfortable?
Youd only....

92
Akiyoshi:
93
 Yes, I really, I dont think I was the only one, but when I was in childhood, I
never even thought about things like that.
I was a very, maybe simple-minded.
When I
was in first grade a third-grade child played the Mozart Turkish March and I liked to play
just like that, thats how I started playing piano, studying piano.
And, uh, always been, if
I listened to my parents at home, if I listened to my teachers at school, Im okay, stay out
of trouble.
So I never really thought about anything.

94
Brown:
95
 So you just recounted your earliest inspiration about piano, you said you heard
another student playing the Mozart Turkish March, so, Rondo Alla Turca (scats a melodic
phrase, last movement of Piano Sonata No.
11 in A Major).

96
Akiyoshi:
97
 Right.

98
Brown:
99
 So this was your first recollection of your interest in music....



100
Akiyoshi:
101
 Yes, piano, yes.

102
Brown:
103
 So ... a classmate?
You say another student played this?

104
Akiyoshi:
105
 Yes, no, no, she was in third grade, I was in first grade.
So, thats when I
started, I wanted to play, so started when I was in first grade, started taking lessons.

106
Brown:
107
 Was this unusual?
Did any of your older sisters have piano lessons, or were
musical?

108
Akiyoshi:
109
 Well (sighs), Im not quite sure.
The only thing, we didnt have piano teacher-
teachers.
I had to learn from, uh, there was a music class teacher (who) was the piano
teacher.
Im not quite sure how great they were, you know, at that particular point, but
Id go twice a week to his home to study.
I still remember it was an upright piano, and I
had to go from where I lived, my family lived, to the teachers house, youd have to walk
for half an hour, to get to the place, you know.
And it was very ... when I think about it
now, I think in many ways, today people would consider, "Boy, that was a hard life," or
something, because everyday youd have to get to school, walk about half an hour, takes
half an hour to get to school, and same thing coming back.
So, uh, I think it is an
American standard, if youre that far, you have a school bus, you know, (we) didnt have
anything like that.
But, this may not be appropriate time or anything, but when my
daughter started going to school here, I realized that I had a much better education than
my daughter.
And ... it was nineteen-sixty .... my daughter was going to PS-41 and it
was sixty-, lemme see, I dont quite remember, it was mid-sixties, I think.
But anyway,
she came back and she said, "Well, (there is) no more music class, because the budget
was cut.
" Now, (she said) the next time, "Oh, no more, uh, what do you call, tais
calisthenics), physical fitness education because of budget cuts.
" And I thought, "What
a strange place that this could be," because when I went to school in Manchuria, Im sure
everybody agrees, Japan was a poor country.
I can tell by looking at old film how life
was very humble and poor, I can tell by films when I see it.
But the whole attitude or
philosophy is like, children must be educated, must be educated, like to be educated,
therefore, budget must be spared.
And, vice versa here.
And, I dont know about today,
but when my daughter went to grammar school, America was the richest country, you
know, I dont think as much debt as today (laughs), deficit as today.
And I thought it was
a very strange country, somehow the priorities were upside down.
So thats what I
remember, so I think I had a very good education, and music education, as well.

110
Brown:
111
 Were all your teachers Japanese?
Do you remember?

112
Akiyoshi:
113
 Oh yes, they were all Japanese, except when I started high school and I started
taking lessons from a pia-... there was a music school there, and then I would go there to


study with, this piano teachers name was Yang (Xiaoyi)-sensei.
We called (him) Y-
sensei, and it was a Chinese person.
Um, miraculously, actually, when I went back to
Manchuria, old Manchuria, for the television, they found him, he was over 80 years old,
and ... Yang-sensei.
And I asked him, "Why (do) you speak Japanese so well?
" He said,
Oh, I went to, I was educated in Japan, Japanese music academy, he went.
It was
Musashino Music School.
And, uh, of course he was two years (in the) Cultural
Revolution, and he was sent to a farm, and he couldnt talk about the music and so on and
so forth, nearly thirty years.
And he was actually permitted to come back and teach, but
that was ....
So he was my teacher, he was a Chinese man, and I still remember, we had
in high school, we had one of our classes was the sewing class, had to sew.
And the high
school had a pool, and I stung my finger with a needle and I went swimming so it kind of
became infected, so I couldnt really play the piano, so I just went--I never missed a
lesson, never, in all that time, Im proud to say--so I went there and I showed Y-sensei
and said, "I cant play because I ...." So he really got mad at me, he said, "Youre a
pianist," you know, "you shouldnt do some stupid things like that," or something like
that.
He got terribly upset and mad at me.

114
Brown:
115
 How old were you?
(chuckles)

116
Akiyoshi:
117
 I was probably about ... fourteen?
Or maybe thirteen and a half?

118
Brown:
119
 So youd been studying for a while by then, six or seven years.

120
Akiyoshi:
121
 Yes, yes.

122
Brown:
123
 Okay.
Um, I asked earlier about your older sisters.
Could you tell me their
names, and if they had any musical training?

124
Akiyoshi:
125
 Who?

126
Brown:
127
 Your older sisters?

128
Akiyoshi:
129
 My oldest sisters name is Hisako (spells it).
The second sisters name is
Miyoko, who is alive and well, we are very close.
And the third sister, it was interesting:
my father, like any other Japanese father, uh, man, they always wanted to have a boy.
So
they got a girl, the next one was a girl, then the third one was also a girl, so he was
hoping, he said, "Well, this will be the zero for the girl," so he named her Reiko.
Rei is
like another word of saying "zero.
" So, then here came (chuckles), here I come
chuckles), so he just named me Toshiko, because thats probably a normal name
laughs).

130
Brown:
131
 Any of them musically inclined, or were either of your parents musically


inclined?

132
Akiyoshi:
133
 No, actually, Im the only one, but my older sister always liked opera, and my
second sister is a quite accomplished Japanese traditional dancer.
My immediate sister
doesnt really have any interest in it.
My mother was interested in music, but she wasnt
very, lets say, she wasnt talented enough.
My father was a student, he was very,
extremely interested in n, N-O-H, you know, mens ....

134
Brown:
135
 N drama?

136
Akiyoshi:
137
 Yes, he studied for quite (a) long time and he actually had a diploma to be, to
be able to teach others.
So he was n singing and dance, but no one was ... my case was
the piano, but the music, you know, was ....

138
Brown:
139
 But it was more Japanese traditional music, not Western or ... well, you said
your sister liked opera ... but the training of everybody was more traditional....

140
Akiyoshi:
141
 No, it isnt.
Because Japanese school, the music class, is all Western.
I
remember when (we were) in grammar school, there was "Home on the Range" (laughs),
things like that were in the book.
And everything was European, Western.
If you were
interested in learning some Japanese music or dancing, you had to do outside-of-school
activity, which my second sister did.

142
Brown:
143
 What kind of music did you hear around the house?
Was music played,
recordings, radio, or maybe outside, down in the streets?
Do you have any memories?

144
Akiyoshi:
145
 Well, when I started to play, started piano, I dont really think much ....
Actually, we had, I think, a gramophone, you had to do by your hands, kind of thing.
And my mother liked it, like Deanna Durbin (laughs).
I remember, (when I was)
seventeen, eighteen, it had, the label part (of the record) had her picture.
And I think it
was probably the Traviata (sings).
I think thats what it was.
Something like that.
But
other than that, I didnt really hear, except my, as I said, my older sister loved opera.
So
when, when I was in the fourth grade, my sister was already in high school way up
there..., no, graduated high school, actually.
And ... Ryy is a very historical city for
Chinese history, I think, because it had a walled city.
But they didnt really have
anything, there was a ... today it is the capital of Liaoning province, its called Shnyang,
Mukden in Manchu), those days it was called Hten (in Japanese).
That was a big city.
And there was a Japanese opera company, called (after founder and tenor) Fujiwara
Yoshie, Fujiwara Opera Company, (that) came there, and my sister wanted to see it.
And, oh, that took ... my mother was traveling, I think she visited her relatives in Japan,
so (she) wasnt there.
My father had to ask to my school to get me off early because (so)
I could take the train.
It took a couple of hours to get there.
And there was ... that was


La Traviata.
I still kind of, sort of remember seeing (it).
Anyway, maybe because of that
I dont like opera (laughs).

146
Brown:
147
 (laughs).
Okay.
So, um, while you were studying piano, did you have any
preferences as far as the repertoire?
Did you like Mozart, Chopin?
Did you like
Beethoven?

148
Akiyoshi:
149
 No, first, (I) started like everybody else.
You start from (Gabriel) Baille and
Carl) Czerny 30 (New Studies in Technique), 40 (Daily Exercises).
About 40, then you
went to other things, then the same time you do (a) sonatina.
By the time it was Yang-
sensei it was sonatas.
But, like every other, studying piano, there was a normal
procedure.
Its not like today, people do some other different ways.
So that was the way
it was.
I didnt really have any preference or anything.
But when I went to high school,
as I said, going to the sonatas, obviously it was Mozart and Beethoven, and, uh, I was
very much into Beethoven.
I was really ... and then I remember in high school and I
saw, those days it was 78 (RPM records), so its like if you have like a concerto or
something it doesnt go on one (record), so you have to have one or two or three or
something like that (chuckles).
And I still remember Rudolf Serkins Apassionata
Sonata (Piano Sonata No.
23, recorded 1938), and I listened and--ooh, ahh--I really
kind of admired (it), and I was thinking, well, someday maybe Id like to visit Germany.
Things like that.

150
Brown:
151
 So it was Beethovens music?
Was it the particular way of playing it?
Or just
the sound or both?

152
Akiyoshi:
153
 No, I think it was Beethovens music.
His music was ... its not quite ... you
know, I dont think (at) that particular time I didnt think anything the way Im analyzing
today.
Beethovens music is more ... (to) some degree, I think--this is probably a far-
out analysis--but Coltrane, like, compared to Sonny Rollins ... Sonny Rollins, if it was
everyone like that, you might as well forget about it, or something.
Certain things,
Beethoven had certain things, more, try harder kind of things.
Mozart, on the other hand,
is very natural and sounds always like angels or whatever it is, or, sounds more natural,
and it wasnt interesting to me.
Beethoven was the one I kind of identified myself with.
So I think everybody is different, but it was just, thats what I kind of, I think, identify,
you know.

154
Brown:
155
 Did you finish high school before your family emigrated to Japan?

156
Akiyoshi:
157
 No.
No.
Before I finished high school (the) war was ended.
So I was an
honorary graduate," just like anybody else in my class.
So, thats the year I was
supposed to graduate, the following year in March.
Here, everything (begins) is
September, but in Japan it was March, the (school year) starts from April.
So the war


ended in August, so there were a few more months to go, which we all did not go, we just
graduated "honorary" (chuckles).

158
Brown:
159
 So when the war started, do you remember, did it impact your life, or,
economically or consciously?

160
Akiyoshi:
161
 Oh yes, of course (sighs).
You know, one of the things about that ...
I have
been ...
I wasnt going to school in Japan, so I have no experience of air raid, I have no
experience of severe conditions, because Manchuria was still ... and also something to do
with my fathers business, I dont remember having a problem with a shortage of food or
things like that.
So actually I didnt really start thinking til I was third year in high
school, there was....
Either you started going to a factory to sew military clothes, or also,
if you wanted to become a nurse.
And I thought, well, in the war if I can do something, I
should become a nurse, and I volunteered to become a nurse.
And I went to my mother
and I said my father said it was okay, and I went to my father (laughs) and I said my
mother said it was okay, because my fathers business was in Ryy, so still he
periodically visited, but I was in a school in Dairen, and at that time, because Im
probably the youngest, my mother came with me to live.
So (the family) was kind of,
sort of separated, in a sense.
So I told both, "He said okay, she said okay" (chuckles).

162
Brown:
163
 (laughs)

164
Akiyoshi:
165
 So I went and I had training for four months, and (after) four months training
was going to be finished, thats when the war was ended (laughs).

166
Brown:
167
 So then what happened.

168
Akiyoshi:
169
 Then, after that it was very difficult.
Uh, what I understand is this may not be
all the gossip, it could be very true.
Because when you start thinking about how the
Japanese military runs, what I understand was the ones who decided, they had a meeting,
they thought maybe ... you know, we were about fifteen and a half years old, all (of) us,
to give them (students) poison, instead of them becoming prisoners of war or something,
thats what I understand.
That was actually, even that came up at the meeting.
So Im
very happy to know that they decided to try to send them back to their parents.
That was
a very hard trip when I think about it, because you had to go under the..., at that time,
Russia was already into the war and Russians were already into Manchuria.
So, under
the hiding from them, you had to go to certain points, you stay in ground....

170
Brown:
171
 Underground.

172
Akiyoshi:
173
 Not underground, a tent, you know what I mean.
Id never done that before
laughs).
So that was kind of a hard trip.
One time we were on the train and the Russian


soldiers came through, and everybody, we all cut our hair very, very short, and it was ...
we had one those uniforms, and it was dark so there wasnt anything (that) happened or
anything.
That was also kind of (a) not pleasant experience.
Anyway, that was hard and
it was ... think about ... the place where we were trained, it is on the map, it was close to
China.
When youre looking at Manchuria and China, the land is the same, except its
separated by a border, whatever it is.
And Dairen, it is close to China, and Ryy is in
the middle, kind of the middle of Manchuria.
Sort of north in the middle, northeast, little
bit east, in the middle.
And where we were trained, it was close to Dairen, it was west of
Dairen.
The way they came is, they go ...
I was the first one, I left ... they stopped (in)
Ryy, and I stopped, and everybody thought I shouldnt go home, but I did.
Which
means ... logically speaking, Dairen would be the first, because it was closer, than to go
to Ryy, if they were, you know....
But they went around (Dairen), meaning they
probably had to go that way to hide from the so-called enemy.
It took a long time, I think
that was a hard trip.
And when I got off the train and I walked to my home and I got to
my home, there were Russian soldiers (who) were taking all (of our) things from (the)
house (chuckles).
And our house was in front of a park, you know, and in the park, (there
were) all these Chinese merchants waiting (chuckles).
And they go there and they were
selling (our things), of course, the Russians, and theyd come back and get more
chuckles), take something away.
I was....

174
Brown:
175
 So your family wasnt in the house?

176
Akiyoshi:
177
 Of course they were.

178
Brown:
179
 But everybody was still taking out the belongings?

180
Akiyoshi:
181
 Of course.

182
Brown:
183
 While they were there?

184
Akiyoshi:
185
 They were soldiers, you know.
And, uh, so I just came home (in) the middle
of all this.
My father he was like really, I think he was probably frightened, "Oh my
God!
" (chuckles).
So that was.... And the next day, he had arranged so that there would
be an underground, you know, you can go to a.... You know Japanese have tatami
bamboo woven floor mats), and under tatami was the floor, and under the floor was a
little room for ... just a little bit of room so we could just hide there.

186
Brown:
187
 So you were hiding underneath the tatami, underneath the floor.
You were
hiding from the soldiers because you were afraid that they would...?

188
Akiyoshi:
189
 Thats right, because they came, but you never know.
They basically came to
get the stuff, but sometimes they were not....
So, you know....



190
Brown:
191
 So after they ransacked your house, then what happened with your family?

192
Akiyoshi:
193
 Oh, just, we were fine, I was the only one who wasnt together (with them),
except my oldest sister was married to a military man, so they were in China, they
werent there.
Um ... this was, as I said, it was 1946, uh...1945, excuse me, summer,
and til 1946 we were permitted, we left there, the first time it was occupied by Russians,
then there was the Chinese communist army, and at that time they occupied ... a
lieutenant--actually his wife was also a lieutenant--they occupied our houses upstairs.
And then after that, it was the (Chinese) Nationalist Army, Chiang Kai-sheks army, and
they occupied the upstairs, too.
The time we were leaving, they were getting, you know,
more communists were coming in, but thats when we left.
But it took, uh, it was almost
a year.
But, I think we were earlier than the people in Dairen.

194
Brown:
195
 So what happened to your fathers business?

196
Akiyoshi:
197
 Well, what happened?
(laughs) I mean, we couldnt have anything....
Everyone who went back to Japan from any(where) abroad--not just China, Im sure
there were other places--they could only bring what you could carry.
No jewels.
And
also, there was a ... (the) yen changed to new (currency), so all the money, it didnt mean
anything, and it was a ...
I remember it was one person, 1000 per person, was given by
the) government when you got into Japan.
So we were four children with parents, so I
think it was 6000 was given from the government.
I remember getting into ... its near
Hiroshima, a place called Ujina, you know, port, and you got in there and you got DDT
on the top of your hair, bong (laughing)!

198
Brown:
199
 Really?

200
Akiyoshi:
201
 Yeah, yeah (laughs).

202
Brown:
203
 So as (laughs) soon as you got to the port, they disinfect(ed) everybody like that?

204
Akiyoshi:
205
 Well, I think it was because everybody was coming back from wherever it
was, theyre probably, maybe carry(ing) something.
American soldiers, we all got
powder, white powder, DDT, pshoo, pshoo (laughs).

206
Brown:
207
 Oh, from American soldiers.

208
Akiyoshi:
209
 Of course, from (the) American side, you know (chuckles).

210
Brown:
211
 So what was your first impression when you got back to Japan?
(Was) this your
first time in Japan, then?


212
Akiyoshi:
213
 No, I had been several times with my mother, because my mother often
visited, and because I was the youngest, so she always took me along, so many times.
But (sighs), first, I tell you, first my impression from Ujina port back to where my parents
came from--we settled in Beppu city--and the train, to me the train looked like a real toy
train, because I think I mentioned earlier, the train in Manchuria was wider, railroad was
wider, and a much better train, and in Japan it was still kind of narrow.
Even today if you
go to some parts, northern parts or someplace, also Hokkaid railroad, its still old,
narrow.
So first my impression was, "What a small train!
" (chuckles).

214
Brown:
215
 So youre sixteen years old, youve already (laughs) got training as a nurse, a
volunteer nurse, you have piano lessons.
Do you have an idea of what life, or what you
want to do for a career?

216
Akiyoshi:
217
 No, actually, my parents wanted me to go to medical school.
But we got back
to Japan in July--I dont quite remember, fourteenth or fifteenth, I think, middle of July
anyway--and I mentioned earlier that the Japanese school starts (in the) spring, so I had a
few months.
And meanwhile, (in) Beppu I saw this dance hall, they had a flier pasted on
the window saying "Pianist wanted.
" So I went in because ...
I knew my parents no
longer could furnish me with a piano, it was that kind of condition.
They didnt even
have a place to live of their own for the time being.
So, uh, I went in and I was hired like
immediately because.... See, Beppu city, it is a very small city, I dont know if you
know), Im sure you do, its a hot spring (resort).
So there was a small (U.S. military)
camp, meaning there were many dance halls for Americans.
And, as you know,
Americans could not come to Japanese (places), Japanese could not go to Americans.
So Japanese wanted to dance, too, so there were Japanese dance halls, a few of them.
There werent that many musicians living in Beppu.
So I said, "I play piano," and I was
hired just like that (chuckles).

218
Brown:
219
 And Beppu is B-E-P-P-U?

220
Akiyoshi:
221
 Yes.

222
Brown:
223
 So, uh, what kind of band, what was the instrumentation for this band?

224
Akiyoshi:
225
 Its leader was a violin player.
I suspect he probably was, used to be (in) the
navy band.
He was an elderly person, everybody else was younger.
And it was violin,
accordion, drums, alto saxophone, piano.
Thats it.

226
Brown:
227
 All Japanese musicians?

228
Akiyoshi:
229
 Of course.
And there was a Hit Kit ... you remember Hit Kit?
I dont know.

Army Navy) Hit Kit (of Popular Songs) is one of the things that the servicemen ... every
month or maybe twice a month, Im not quite sure, it was American hit songs.
It was for
the American servicemen.
And you could get them, I think they had all those, you know,
Five Minutes More," or like "Shoo Fly Pie," what have you (laughs), things like that.
It
was lead sheets, thats what they played.
I didnt know any chord symbols, Id never
seen (those) in my life.
So I said, "Whats this?
" So the violin player said, "Oh she
doesnt know anything!
" And, uh, "Can you play piano?
" So I played Beethovens
Sonata No.
3 (sings), and he said, "Oh, she can play piano!
" (laughs) So that was the
beginning.
And, uh, I was hired for the dance hall for Japanese.
I think that was
probably a good... it was lucky, because a Japanese record collector....
When jazz was
exported to other countries--I dont know about Europe, but exported to Japan--they
mostly appealed to the upper-middle-class young people.
So they had, some of them had
collected records.
And this person was Mister Fukui.
Hes still alive and well, I hope.
I
saw him three years ago.
But ... he was one of the collectors.
And he noticed my
playing, so he invited me over to his home, and he played Teddy Wilsons "Sweet
Lorraine"--this became a very famous story.
But when I heard him playing it, I said, "I
want to play just like that!
" So that was my first introduction to jazz.
And I think it was
lucky the fact that he played Teddy Wilson, because as you know Teddy Wilson played
such a clean, beautiful--actually swing-style pianists all played very clean--but his in
particular, he had a technique, and his own runs were like the same string of pearls, you
know, like beautifully played, and it was not like today, in the old days people didnt use
the pedal, so they all came out so nice and clean.
And that was really good, I think, it
appealed to me a lot.
So after that I tried to listen to records --he had a couple of
different records--and about eight months later, I was hired in Fukuoka city.
So I moved
to Fukuoka city.
I was seventeen years old, I think, seventeen years old.
My parents
were like (groans).
But one thing about ... when Japan lost the war, there was a certain
structure that was broken, in other words, the family, the structure had always been the
father was the beginning, was at the middle, and hes the big pole; the mother (was) the
support, the parents, and the children were supposed to listen to the parents, like that.
When the war was ended my father, for a while he didnt know what (had) come over,
what hit him, because it wasnt his fault that he lost everything, and he hadnt even
foreseen, the Japanese never thought they were going to lose a war.
So, they lost it, he
lost everything, and he really didnt know what to do.
And that affected the children.
I
was at that time fifteen years old, and it just affected.... And when we went back to
Japan that was already broken, the way my father had to try to find a place for us to live,
too, and so on, and meanwhile I took a job in a dance hall, and that was, like, unthinkable
for ... my father got really mad.
But, uh (chuckles), because the normal situation in
Japan in those days, the girls never worked, they dont work til they go to ... then they
married.
Its not ... if youre in the middle class, the girls are not supposed to work.
So,
its a special dance hall, my God, you know, evil place (laughs).

230
Brown:
231
 (laughs) What else, what ... you mentioned a few titles, but what was the


repertoire?
I mean, what was the repertoire you were playing, so this gives an idea of
what kind of dancing was going on?

232
Akiyoshi:
233
 Well, I dont quite remember everything.
As I said, I remember "Sweet Sue,"
you know, "Shoo Fly Pie," or "Five Minutes More," I remember those.
"Home on the
Range" was there, too.
Things like that.
I dont remember til later on when I was hired
and then moved to Fukuoka, and I was hired by a big band.
This was the first big band
excitedly), and it was Rytar Yamada and his band, his orchestra.

234
Brown:
235
 Say it again?
What was his name?

236
Akiyoshi:
237
 Rytar Yamada, yes.
He was an old musician, played trumpet and piano, I
understand.
But (at) the officers club, you kind of had to, somebody had to stand in the
front to wave his arms (conduct), so he had to do that, so he needed a pianist.
So I was
the one.
And this was really great, because the officers club had a--we call (it)
denchiku, you know what I mean?--like a gramophone, you had to do by hand, but this
was, because it was plugged in, you didnt have to do that.
And....

238
Brown:
239
 Like a jukebox?

240
Akiyoshi:
241
 Yes, it was more like a jukebox, not really, but its still a gramophone, it was
the same thing, except it was run by gears, electric.
And theyre bigger.
And that was
the first time I saw a V-disc (Victory disc).
V-disc was a 12-inch, you know, plastic, like
before that, a 17-inch, if you dropped it, it broke.
But this didnt break.
So that was like
a pioneer of, later on, the 10-inch LP, I think.
Because this was already 45 (RPM) speed.
And thats when ... daytime I could practice piano there and I listened to all those
records.
Thats the first, that was a really great job for me.
And then I ... and then of
course this was a large ensemble, so they had, you know, the stock arrangements, they
were given by, I think, the American side to the band.
So they were all stock
arrangements.
And then, stock arrangements usually, like a four-bars intro, then they
have ensemble, then there was a (place to) modulate, because the middle part was for the
singer.
So thats what ... since we didnt have a singer ... and stock arrangements
usually had a tenor solo, trumpet solo, something like that, then it was ensemble, then
finish.
That was a stock arrangement.
And I remember a lot of those.
And I remember
one was ... the pianist had nothing to do, you know, in a big band, just chang-chang, so
one day there was a new one, it was "Near You," and its middle part was a piano solo.
And I was very excited, of course (laughs).
So (scats) "near you" (scats) "near you.
" So
I was ... (in the) daytime I practiced my "improvisation" (laughs).
I practiced my
improvisation" like mad!
I was hoping he (Yamada) was gonna call that sometime, and
then one day he called it, and my heart went doot-doot-doot, so I played what I practiced.
So, Mr. Yamada said, "Everybody backstage!
" You know, there was a band room.
And
he said, "Did you hear her play?
Did you hear her play?
Just because she tried to come


up with something, she sounds like a Filipino!
" (laughs) Those days, Philippine players
had better sense as a jazz player, so obviously, because they were under, they were
colonized by America for a long, long time.
So theyre exposed to jazz longer than
laughs) Japanese.
And that was really funny!

242
Brown:
243
 So that was a compliment.

244
Akiyoshi:
245
 Yeah!

246
Brown:
247
 (laughs, claps) Well, lets go back, you said the first jazz recording you heard
was Teddy Wilson.
Teddy Wilson is improvising.
Up until this point, had you even
improvised?
Had you even ...?

248
Akiyoshi:
249
 Yes.
No, I prac-- I had to take from records.
I had to take the solo and song,
because I didnt know any songs.
So solos, and I tried to play that solo.
It doesnt make
any difference, especially when I was in Fukuoka, I took a solo, from eight bars, you
know, Wilsons solos, things like that, everybodys.
And then I tried to play it on the
piano.

250
Brown:
251
 So you were transcribing, or just by ear memorizing and then playing,
transposing to piano?

252
Akiyoshi:
253
 No, I had to play many times to, just to....

254
Brown:
255
 So you were actually writing and transcribing?

256
Akiyoshi:
257
 Right, exactly.

258
Brown:
259
 And then you used that?
Okay, so were going to change tapes.

260
Akiyoshi:
261
 Okay.

262
Brown:
263
 Okay, Toshiko-san, I wanted for you to, um, as much as possible to describe that
process, since you were classically trained as a pianist, and you heard Teddy Wilson, and
so, Teddy Wilson is improvising, so what is it ... how did you acquire the ability to
improvise?

264
Akiyoshi:
265
 By taking all (of it) from records.
(It) took me a long time to take it, because I
didnt have that quick (an) ear.
And many times, you know, play it, and then take it on
the sheet music, and then I tried to play that, as many as I could.
That is the way I
learned, mainly, the jazz language.
Also, the different tunes, you know, different....
Because there wasnt anything, books, or anything like that in those days.
Interesting


thing is, like--I said Mister Fukui, I told you about, so I was there (Beppu), and then I
moved to Fukuoka and I was in the officers club, and I did the same thing, listen to
records and take out, now... and I tried to play it on piano.
And thats how I learned.
Meanwhile, Mister Fukui sent me the book, How to Play Jazz Piano (possibly Modern
Piano Method, 1933), it was a piano kysoku hon (method book), you know, like a lesson
book, written by Vincent Lopez.
Id never heard (of him) before.
And as ... you have to
remember that Id just started, I didnt know anything about anything.
And when I think
of it now, apparently this was like a ragtime piano book, and, uh, this was the first time I
saw, what do you call, you know, stride, un-cha, un-cha, un-cha, stride.
Yeah, I saw, the
first time in my life I saw this, and it had "Twelfth Street Rag" and things like that in
there.
So, this was really exciting to me, and I was trying to play.
And, uh, Mister Fukui
much, much later, he was talking to me about his memories, which Id forgotten
completely.
He said, "I sent you a book, and a week later you sent me (it) back.
So I
thought, Maybe she didnt like it.
" And I said to him, I said, "No, I copied everything,"
so I said .... Now, when I start thinking, thats true, that happened.
So, he was really
encouraged, he probably felt like a Professor Higgins!
(laughs) Anyway, so ... that was
very exciting, doing all this.
But its mainly, learn (to) improvise or something by getting
to know the players.
In those days I had no discrimination, I copied everybody ... and,
uh, to get used to jazz language.
Then, as I mentioned earlier, on "Near You" I would try
to, you know, play my own, but not truly improvise, but it was practicing my
improvisation, and I kind of performed that, but do what I was going to do.
Something
like that.
So, by doing this, I learned a little at a time, I became my own.
I think its one
of the good things, I think about, is when you dont have a book, youre not learning from
a book.
But if you learn something from a book, you go one process, you go with the
head, then you have to digest that one.
But (if) youre doing (it) by yourself, copying a
book, copying a record and trying to play it, theres no one cushion.
So once you did
that, its already yours, digested.
I think its the hardest way but probably the best way.
Charles Mingus, when later on I was with his group, and we used to rehearse (at) his
apartment, he had no written music or anything, he sang (the melody), and you have to
remember that.
You know, I think thats the best way, to .... Small group, I guess, you
cant do that with a large ensemble (laughs).

266
Brown:
267
 Well, I worked with Cecil, Cecil Taylor does!
(laughs)

268
Akiyoshi:
269
 But thats the best way.
And, uh, my case was, thats why I say "learn by
yourself," by that .... Its always been one way, maybe, Im grappling, maybe ... it was
not so convenient a time as today, there werent any records available, you couldnt buy
them), first of all.
But, on the other hand, it was probably a good time, thats the way I
had to learn, which was probably was the best way.
So ... so, by the time when I went to
Tokyo, which was 58, I believe, somewhere....

270
Brown:
271
 No, 58?


272
Akiyoshi:
273
 No, gomen, Im sorry.

274
Brown:
275
 48, 48.

276
Akiyoshi:
277
 I think it was (19)48, uh, it was summer.
And, uh, I was a little bit, I was a
little bit, kinda, trying to play, improvise and so on and so on, you know.
When I went to
.. Mister Yamada, he was an old man, I mean an old-timer.
There were a few old
timers, Japanese old times, who used to play on the boats.
I think, one of the most
important, probably the one was (trumpeter) Mister Fumio Nanri, because (they) had a
Nanri award set up by Swing Journal.
Im the first recipient.
But, that was a long time
ago (1975)....
But anyway, he was a trumpet player.
And all those musicians were, after
the war, whenever they started they were the ones who used to be leaders of certain
groups, and so on.
There was a trombone player, played a little bit like Jack Teagarden,
and tried to sing like that, too.
That was in Tokyo.
So I really wanted to go to Tokyo,
because there wasnt anything in Fukuoka that I could learn.
And he (Yamada) gave me
an introduction letter to (one of) his old players, you know, old buddies, a drummer, his
name was Ikoma, Tokuji Ikoma, I think it was.
And also he gave me 5000 as a gift, you
know, a going-away present.
That was my monthly salary in those days.
And in those
days that was considered a very, very good salary.
And ... it was Tokyo ... there were
most, there were a lot of clubs, dance halls.
There werent any jazz clubs, its a dance
hall, and usually the top floor of a department store.
And it was one in Gotanda, it was
Shirokiya department (store), top floor, and there was a ... they were playing for the
dancers in the daytime.
I went there and ... he died several years ago, he was a drummer
called George Kawaguchi, who is very well known.
And, uh, most people dont know
that there was Teruo Yoda, he was a tenor saxophone player, and theres Fumio
Matsumoto, a trumpet player.
And they were playing.
And I thought, "Whaa...!
"
laughs), you know, "Whaa, fantastic!
" I was like watching, I was, "I wish I could play
like that!
" That was my ... so, as I say, I had introduction to....
This was a very
interesting thing about ... it was Ikoma and his band, this was a show band.
And Tokyo
station, Marunouchi side--I dont quite remember if it was six oclock, or five oclock, I
dont quite remember--but you had to be there.
Then you waited, and most of the time,
not all of the time, but most of the time there was an American truck (that) would come,
one of those khaki-colored trucks.
And we got on to that truck and went to the camps.
And, camp, there they had a show, and we had to back up, so we were a show band, so
you had to be able to sight-read.
So, I was a pretty good sight-reader in those days, you
know, so I got a job and that was ... sometimes a juggler, sometimes an opera singer
came, you know.
And I still remember, her name was Araki, I think, Miss Araki, I still
remember her face; she was a very beautiful woman.
But.
anyway, she would sing, and I
had to back up on piano.
All these things.
And the juggler was great, because the
juggler usually (was) a small-group jam session, because there was no music, other than,
usually had music and you had very little, said, "You go from here to here," blah, blah,


blah, so on and so on.
Juggler was just, "We want the tempo about like that" or
something, and we just had to....
This was (the) most, you know, fun.

278
Brown:
279
 You were mostly jamming.

280
Akiyoshi:
281
 Yeah, well, mostly, yeah, right (laughs).
I dont know how well I did, I
probably did pretty bad.
So did everybody else.
But, uh, that was ... sometimes wed go
to two different places in one night.
Go from there, go from there, something.
Sometimes no check would come and there was no job (chuckles).
Something like that.
It was kind of interesting because that was very good experience, because it was
something that you had to do at that particular moment (chuckles).
We got a job, I
should say he got a job at an officers club, St. Luke hospital at, uh ... its still there, at
Tsukiji, there was an officers club there.
And, uh, Mister Ikomas band got a job there
chuckles).
The first time I had this long dress (chuckles).
It was ... there, I had to wear
them, you know, so it looked nice or something (chuckles).
I was cursed ...
I think it was
..
I was seventeen years old at that time, maybe going on eighteen, something like that.

282
Brown:
283
 Were you the only woman in the band?

284
Akiyoshi:
285
 No.
There were no women in the band, um, there were no women in the
band.... Any woman in the band those days in Japan was a pianist.
There were no horn
players, in Japan those days.
Now, you know, now there are a few, but....

286
Brown:
287
 Now, when you first got to Tokyo, you said you saw the band, and you said,
Oh, I want to play like them.
" What style were they playing?
Were they already
playing bebop?
Or were they playing...?

288
Akiyoshi:
289
 Who?

290
Brown:
291
 The musicians, you said, when you first got to Tokyo.

292
Akiyoshi:
293
 Oh, no, no.

294
Brown:
295
 You said, "Oh, I want to play like...."

296
Akiyoshi:
297
 Those days, everything was swing style.

298
Brown:
299
 Swing style.

300
Akiyoshi:
301
 Everything was swing style.
So the drummer would play (scats), like that
chuckles).


302
Brown:
303
 Right.

304
Akiyoshi:
305
 Anyway....

306
Brown:
307
 Can you do that again?
(laughs)

308
Akiyoshi:
309
 (Laughs).
Anyway, so I was actually pretty in demand, because I was playing
like Teddy Wilson style, everything was that.
And there was a number one pianist in
those days, his name was Mister Matsui, Hachir Matsui.
He had, he was playing with a
small group, and there was another department store, the top floor, and, uh, Ikoma-san
thought I should study with him.
So he says, "Well, I dont teach, but if you want to
come watch me play, its fine.
" So off-days, which was quite often, I went to his place,
where hes playing, and it was called "Tokyo Jive" (laughs), thats the name of the group.

310
Brown:
311
 Jive.

312
Akiyoshi:
313
 It was a quintet (chuckles).
And, uh, I would sit next to him and I watched
him play.
I remember when I tried to play like that, I said, "Very soon, I will play like
Matsui-san," and Matsui-san was the leader and so I got a job with this trombone player
who had a band, in another department (store), called Isetan--its still there, though, in
Shinjuku, up there.
There was a ... this was for American people, and trombone player
was the leader, Mister Mori.
Tru Mori.
I was hired because I played like Matsui-san
laughs).

314
Brown:
315
 (Laughs)

316
Akiyoshi:
317
 Like that.
Then ... after that, I was ...
I was in a ...
I was actually, after that I
was hired (by) Tokyo Jive, because Mister Matsui got ... he had written some music that
became a hit, and he was hired by a movie company.
So I was his, you know,
predecessor (successor) or whatever (chuckles).
And so ... playing there, there was a
pianist named Akimitsu (Yoshitaka).

318
Brown:
319
 Akimitsu?

320
Akiyoshi:
321
 He came to me, he said, you know, um, "Maybe we (should) switch jobs.
"
And in those days there was a thing called "bebop," it was already in Japan.
And
grumbles), "Bebop, thats not music," something like that.
So, he was playing with a
band called Ichiban Octet...

322
Brown:
323
 (laughs)

324
Akiyoshi:
325
 ... group, and this was a bebop band.


326
Brown:
327
 Really?

328
Akiyoshi:
329
 So he really didnt want that.
He wanted to play swing style piano.
And so,
he came to me, said, you know, "Maybe we switch the piano, you play there, and I play
with this group.
" And then I said, "Well, I dont know," I mean....
But I thought, "I
shouldnt knock something that I dont even know.
I should learn, then knock!
" (laughs)

330
Brown:
331
 (Laughs)

332
Akiyoshi:
333
 So, okay, I took a job, I was the piano player with Ichiban Octet.
This was the
group that was playing in the Shinagawa depot.
This was the first, this was
predominantly black people.
I think maybe it was a sergeants club, Im not quite sure.

334
Brown:
335
 You said, where was it?
Shinagawa?

336
Akiyoshi:
337
 Shinagawa.
And there was a ... today Shinagawa ... today, its the east side,
which is the ocean side, there was nothing there.
Today it is the most hip place.
Even
Dean & Deluca has a store (there).
Its like a really upscale, and uh, (as) famous here as
the Oyster Bar in the station, (Grand) Central Station, they have a restaurant over there,
the east side.
But in those days there was nothing there.
And then, from that side, there
was this club.

338
Brown:
339
 And the name of the club again?

340
Akiyoshi:
341
 I dont remember.
As I said, this club is the ... the Ichiban Octet--I dont
even know if it had a name, because it was for the Americans, as I said, it was all black
musicians, I mean, excuse me, troops....

342
Brown:
343
 Black soldiers.

344
Akiyoshi:
345
 Soldiers.
Every once in a while I saw white soldiers, but it couldve been a
sergeants club, Im not quite sure.
But it was something to do with shipping, something
depot.

346
Brown:
347
 Quartermasters depot?

348
Akiyoshi:
349
 Yes, thats it, quartermaster depot.

350
Brown:
351
 Now, you mentioned a club, or a camp before, was that Camp Zama that you ....

352
Akiyoshi:
353
 No.


354
Brown:
355
 ...said the truck used to come and get you?
What was that?
Remember, you
said you guys would wait for the truck to come and get you and take you to a camp?

356
Akiyoshi:
357
 I have no idea where they were.

358
Brown:
359
 (Laughs) Okay.

360
Akiyoshi:
361
 But I know it was in Tokyo.
And as I mentioned, I said it would go from one
place to another sometimes.

362
Brown:
363
 Yeah.

364
Akiyoshi:
365
 So, Im not quite sure where they were.
I have no idea.
I dont even know
where Zama is even today.

366
Brown:
367
 (Chuckles)

368
Akiyoshi:
369
 But, so, that was, this was a totally different, one place and so on.
This band
was my very first bebop band, and they had like, uh, Illinois Jacquet playing, it was
called "Jet Propulsion.
" And he solos, you know, and the introduction was piano, da-
DAH da-da-da-da-da-da-dan-dan-dan, something like that.
Anyway, this was the first
time I really felt like I was in a jazz band.
It was really exciting and we had "A Night in
Tunisia," "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," all these stock arrangements.

370
Brown:
371
 Mmmm!

372
Akiyoshi:
373
 And there was a black trumpet player--I dont remember the name, I dont
really think I knew the name--he was, every once and a while, he rehearsed (with) the
group.
It was an octet, it was led by an old timer, hes a tenor saxophone player, his
name was Shin Matsumoto--um, Shintar, Shintar?
(repeats, Shin is correct)--I dont
quite remember his ... first name, but last name was Matsumoto, he was an old timer.
He
was considered the "Coleman Hawkins of Japan" (laughs).
But it was playing ... that
was very, very exciting, it was like this particular one had stock arrangements, so they
had, like, the solo was always, you know, someone who played it, it was already written.
And Matsumoto-san would play this Illinois Jacquet solo.
It sounded so hip to me--
wow, thats fantastic!
(laughs).

374
Brown:
375
 So you had tenor saxophone, trumpet, uh....

376
Akiyoshi:
377
 Tenor saxophone, trumpet, and there was a G.I., Japanese American--I dont
quite remember, I see the face--alto saxophone (probably James Araki) He was the


saxophone, and the one with the glasses, I dont remember the name, he was the trumpet
player.
Then there was a ... tenor saxophone.
There was a guitar.
The guitar player and
I had a fight, so thats how I remember the guitar player (laughs).

378
Brown:
379
 (Laughs).
What did you fight about?

380
Akiyoshi:
381
 Ah, I dont remember, I think it was I never liked the guitar, you know, they
always kinda ... very difficult to play together, unless you have some kind of
understanding.
And of course I was immature, Im sure he was immature, too.
So we
had a lot of problems.
But it was ... the drummer ...
I wish I remembered the alto
players name, but he was a Japanese American, I think from Hawaii, I dont remember.
But there was, I think, it was an octet, maybe there was a couple of trumpet players,
possibly.
I dont remember, I dont remember whether this trumpet player wore glasses,
then alto, the lead alto, and Matsumoto-san was the tenor saxophone player.
There was a
guitar and drums ... drummer and the bass player I dont remember who they were,
either.
But, uh....

382
Brown:
383
 Did they really capture the bebop style?

384
Akiyoshi:
385
 Bebop style?
Probably.
I dont know.
I dont remember anything, besides
the fact that I was just introduced to it and I couldnt tell one way or another, probably
chuckles).
The first bebop players, at that time, there was young musicians, together
they were called CB9, for some reason.
They were playing in Yokohama.
And they
were the ... Jun Shimizu, he was the first bebop player, one of those, you know, broken
rhythm, he was the first one.
And, uh, Im not quite sure, but I couldnt probably tell in
those days if it was bebop or not.
I wasnt even in a position to criticize anyone
chuckles).

386
Brown:
387
 Had you heard, uh, Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie records by this time?

388
Akiyoshi:
389
 No, I hadnt.
But they used to sing in "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," dah-da-da-dah,
something like that, so on and so on.
So, still, I hadnt even heard Bud Powell.
That was
still.... Then after this ...
I was asked to play in another band, called Gay Stars
chuckles), thats a big band.
Then there was another one, this was called Six Lemons.
It
was Six Lemons ... by this time, I was really copying things--by the time when I went to
Six Lemons, there were jazz coffee shops sprouting in all places--and around those
times, I heard Bud Powell.

390
Brown:
391
 About what year is this now, maybe fift--.

392
Akiyoshi:
393
 I would say 50.
I would say 50, 51.
I would think 51.
But there was an
Armed Forces Radio Service, they had a jazz hour, and I heard this "Body and Soul" and


its beautifully played, and I said, "Wow, who could that be?
" and that was Bud Powell.
Since then, I tried to listen to him, and pretty much the same time there was a jazz coffee
shop, you know.
Those days, records were costing--I think it was the black market, you
could only buy in the black market--it was 3000.
And those days if you were a
graduate of an Ivy (League) college and got a job in a bank, the first salary was 6000 in
Japan, monthly, you know.
So you know how expensive the records were.
So these were
probably bought on the black market from a PX who would buy....
So my learning place
was the jazz coffee shop, and I went there and listened to records and tried to learn the
tunes.
And by that time there were many Bud Powell records and so on.
And the place I
went most was a in Yokohama, a place called Chigusa.
Its gone but....
The owner of
Chigusa (Yoshida Mamoru), he actually received a medal from Yokohama city, as a
contributor to the cultural scene of Yokohama, something like that.
He died quite some
time ago (1994).
But most jazz coffee shops were very small; this one was particularly
small, maybe like six people, be like, thats it.

394
Brown:
395
 (Chuckles)

396
Akiyoshi:
397
 And I would listen to records.
And uh, you know, as I said before, you cant
copy by (listening) one time only, so I would have to ask her, ask him, I said, "Im sorry,
but could you play that please again?
" and he would say, "Yes!
" and he would do that,
and I tried....
So, you know, this is the LP time, so probably quite a lot of his records at
one point were pretty, went down!
(laughs)

398
Brown:
399
 (Chuckles)

400
Akiyoshi:
401
 But those were very, very important school, you know, places for me, or
somebody like ... now, this was, I have another place about, away from here, its a little
small house that I work there, because theres nothing there, you know, no telephone or
anything, thats where I usually go to work.
But I put it there, but there was.... Quite
some time ago, I still had a large ensemble, and someplace, it could be Indiana, Im not
quite sure, (there was) a concert.
The presenter came to me and said, "I have a surprise
for you, somebody wants to present you something.
" And this man came with a sketch of
me.
He sketched while I was listening to records (laughs).

402
Brown:
403
 At the coffee shop?

404
Akiyoshi:
405
 Yes, coffee shop.
So he gave this to me and its in a corner in my, you know,
other place.
But, that was a ... coffee cost, I think, 50 in those days, you know, so you
had one coffee then you stay there three hours or something, chart another tune, or so on
and so on.

406
Brown:
407
 (Chuckles)



408
Akiyoshi:
409
 And Bud Powells record was ... the first one, I think he was 23 years old, his
first (as a) leader.
And my first recording, which was done by Norman Granz, you know,
at the recommendation from the late Oscar Peterson, I was 23 years old, so I thought,
Whoa, this is something!
" (laughs)

410
Brown:
411
 (Laughs) Lets go back to when you first got to Tokyo, um, about your
impressions of Tokyo, and where you first stayed.
Did you have any con ... you had this
letter of introduction,

412
Akiyoshi:
413
 Yes.

414
Brown:
415
 you had a job....

416
Akiyoshi:
417
 No, no, no.

418
Brown:
419
 ...but did you have a place to stay?
How did you, what was your social
situation?

420
Akiyoshi:
421
 My mothers friend was quite wealthy, they had a house in Setagaya, and
uh....

422
Brown:
423
 Where?

424
Akiyoshi:
425
 Setagaya, which is like, uh ... here it would be, say, oh....

426
Brown:
427
 Well, I have a map of Tokyo, would it be...?

428
Akiyoshi:
429
 Yes, Setagaya-ku (ward), yes.
Setagaya-ku is a more residential area.
They
have a densha (train) from Shibuya station to, on the way to Yokohama.

430
Brown:
431
 Oh, Shibuya.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

432
Akiyoshi:
433
 They had a house, so I had one room upstairs they rented to me.
So, those
days ... later, yeah, I also left there and went to other places.
But its always, those days
I was always renting one room or the upstairs.
Later on, before, maybe a year before I
came to this country, I was in Shinagawa, and upstairs.... See, in those days, after the
war was ended, many, relatively wealthy people lost income, so they rented out rooms for
the income.
So there was quite a lot of those, yknow.
And, uh, the last one I had, they
converted so there was a kitchen upstairs, and things like that.

434
Brown:
435
 So you actually didnt have a piano in your house where you lived.


436
Akiyoshi:
437
 No.
I did not have a piano til, uh, when I was in the Blue Coats Orchestra, so
that would be 50, 1950, I think.
I think I went to Tokyo in 48, so didnt have any....
But 1950 I was asked to join what was called the Blue Coats Orchestra, and theyre more
like....

438
Brown:
439
 Blue Coats?

440
Akiyoshi:
441
 Blue Coats, you know, right.
And it was funny ... they were very much in a
Les Brown bag kind of thing, more like a dance band, like a middle-of-the-road kind of
thing, and they had ... they asked me to join the orchestra, and my condition was, "Give
me an advance and I can buy a piano.
" So thats what I did.
Thats the first time I had
my (own) upright piano.
And (at) that time I was renting a room that was six mattress
size), you know, rokuj, we call it.
And, uh, I had a piano and I had a bed and it was
very exciting to me (laughs gaily).

442
Brown:
443
 You remember what kind?

444
Akiyoshi:
445
 Uh, it was called Bruckner.
I think it was called Bruckner.
And, uh ... it
really didnt matter to me, whatever, it was okay.
But that was called Bruckner and....
Soon after I bought the piano, the Blue Coats were playing at a Yokohama place, a
civilian club, called the Colonial Club, called Club Colonial, a civilian club.
Les Brown
and Bob Hope came for a USO tour and they played at the stadium in Yokohama and uh
.. for the Americans, you know, you (Japanese) couldnt get in there.
But I kind of
snuck in there (laughs).
Anyway, I got to know the pianist, I think his name was Jeff
Clarkson.
I think his brother used to play with Gene Krupas trio, and I think he was the
brother.
I think he was called Jeff Clarkson.
I asked him to come and play for us.
And
he came to my little place.
We all were kind of excited--I wasnt the only one, there
were others and so on--and he played my piano, you know.
It was "I Got You (My Love
to) Keep Me Warm" or something like that (sings)....

446
Brown:
447
 "Ive Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.
"

448
Akiyoshi:
449
 ...and its got a little piano solo.
I used to play just like that (laughs).
It was
very good, thats the first piano I had, very, very exciting.

450
Brown:
451
 So, that means now youre working at the Colonial Club in Yokohama.
Are you
still working with..., are you working in many bands at this time?

452
Akiyoshi:
453
 No, I moved from one band to another quite, probably three months at a time.
The longest one probably I was--that is, in Tokyo--the longest one probably was maybe
around six months, it was the first band, maybe ... God, uh ... maybe about that much


with the Ichiban Octet.
But most of the time three months with the Blue Coats to Gay
Stars.
After Gay Stars there was a small combo called Six Lemons.
This was....

454
Brown:
455
 Six Lemons?
(chuckles)

456
Akiyoshi:
457
 Six Lemons.
These were supposed to be the best young players.
There were
no jazz clubs and there was a new nightclub, which opened in Ginza.
The manager
was--I forgot the name--he was supposed to be the nightclub manager, and he wanted to
have all the best young musicians together, a sextet, for playing.
And he was asked by ...
I mentioned before, Yoda, Teruo Yoda, who was a tenor saxophonist and played quite
well--he was more like, somewhere between Flip Phillips and, uh, a little like ... you
know, that kind of style, kind of....
So he gathered the musicians and I was elected as the
piano player.
And so we were there.
The drummers name was Frankie Sakai; later on
he became an actor, a movie actor, he actually was quite good at it, he got some kind of
award.
He died quite some time ago.
But he was a natural comedian and there was a
song called "Orange Colored Sky," something like that, and he sang.
And I really hated
it.
So he and I had a big fight (laughs), and I left in the middle of the....
In those days I
had a hot temper.
And, uh, I left and I went back, this was a different place, where I had
a room rented.
And I heard something in the window, I heard Yoda Teruo, he said,
Apologize to her.
Apologize to her.
Shes only a woman.
" (laughs heartily) But
anyway, this was a sextet, we played, and that time--Im sure it was (19)50--the
nightclubs in Japan, there were always girls, you know, beautifully dressed girls around
and da-da-da, and thats when Oscar Pettiford came with his troops to play (at) that Ernie
Pyle theater.
And the Ernie Pyle theater, you (Japanese) couldnt get in, but by that time
Id developed my, what do you call, okkake, here they call ... they call, you know, people
who follow you, fans, not a fan, but you have another word for it....

458
Brown:
459
 Not a stalker?
(laughs)

460
Akiyoshi:
461
 No.
I will think of it in a minute.
So we call it okkake in Japan.

462
Brown:
463
 Like devotee?
No?

464
Akiyoshi:
465
 No, uh, groupie.

466
Brown:
467
 Groupie!
Okay (chuckles).

468
Akiyoshi:
469
 I had groupies, I had American groupies, and they would come ... you know,
this was a Japanese club so Americans are not supposed to be there.
So I had these
groupies, about four of them, they were in the backstage and listening.
And this club,
downstairs there was a coffee shop, Japanese coffee shops are usually restaurants.
Every
once in a while the MPs would come.
So MPs would come, and they would go


downstairs (laughs).
So they were the groupies.
One of the groupies, his nickname ...
we used to call him "Mac," because his whole full name was McCutchen--I dont quite
remember the first name (Harry), but McCutchen--and he was an Air Force sergeant or
something and he was a jazz fan and one of the groupies.
And he told me about Oscar
Pettifords group, and that he would take me to backstage.
And he took me to backstage
and I saw ... this was the first time in my life I saw people warming up.
You know, Id
never seen that, Japanese players (were) never warming up.
And ... J.J. Johnson ... this
group was Oscar Pettiford, J.J. Johnson, Howard McGhee, Rudy Williams, who I didnt
know then, there was (drummer) Charlie Rice, and there was a guitar player (Skeeter
Best).
And because it was a USO tour, they didnt have a pianist.
But I heard J.J.
warming up and that really impressed me, and McKutchen, Mac, said, "Well, this is
Toshiko Akiyoshi, a pianist," and they said, "Oh, hi, excuse me, I have to warm up," and
you know, so.... That was really my first ... "Wow," you know, "a great player like that,
playing a long tone.
" And uh, so I asked ... by the time I was listening to them my job
had already started.
I could tell Yoda-san was steaming mad that "the pianist is not
here.
" And so I asked them to come to where I worked, it was a nightclub.
So ... J.J.,
Oscar Pettiford--I, actually I have a picture somewhere--but anyway, Howard McGhee,
they came, so naturally Yoda-san was very mad, but I came with them so I was forgiven,
so to speak.
And we had a little jam session.
But when I played--at that time I played, I
think I played, probably, "Squatty Roo," I have a feeling I probably played "Squatty
Roo.
" And J.J. said, "Ah, so you like Bud Powell!
" And uh, I really loved Miles Davis,
you know (mumbles), I said, "Hows Miles doing?
" He said, "Oh, you like Miles, huh?
Hes not working.
" (laughs) This was, like, 1950.
I dont think he was working.
That
was ... those (guys) were the American jazz scene.
The fact is, when I came (to
America) in 56 and in 57, I was at the Hickory House for six weeks.
Oscar Pettiford
used to come almost every night and sit in.
And that was the greatest lesson you could
ever have.
On the other hand, when you think about that, why he could come almost
every night, (it was) because he wasnt working.
You know, nowadays if he was, today
people would pay a premium to listen to him.
So those were the days, I think, in a way.

470
Brown:
471
 J.J. didnt explain why Miles wasnt working?
Did he give any indication why?

472
Akiyoshi:
473
 No, he just said, "Hes not working," thats all.
Anyway, there werent that
many jobs, probably, because Oscar Pettiford, it was the same thing much later, like six,
seven years later.
But, um, that time ...
I started thinking about that I really didnt want
to play in a dance band, you know, dance music.
You had to play dance music, of
course, thats what it was for.
So I made my own group.
I quit and I made my own
quartet and ... how I named it, I said it was small, so I named it the Cozy Quartet.
So it
was called Cozy Quartet, first one.
That was my first one.
And, uh, til then I was the
top-paid sideman, sideperson, player in Japan, I was getting 50,000, which today ... if I
were a little clever, if I were a little more, better minded person rather than just thinking
of playing, playing, playing, I wouldve bought land.
Id have been a billionaire today


laughs).

474
Brown:
475
 (laughs)

476
Akiyoshi:
477
 But its okay.
Everything works out.
But it was, I just ... that was a departure
for me.
And after that, I had a very difficult time, you know, economically at that time.
But, I didnt stop, so I was somehow ... since then, most of the time, I would start
playing at a place like a service club, because you could play (jazz), and my best job was
in Yokohama, a place called Seamens Club.
And it was a small ... it was a seamens
club.
Almost once a week they had a fight, you know, a big fight.
The owner, I think,
was a Marine lawyer or something, American, who was married to a Japanese.
The lady
was a beautiful lady, used to be an old titled familys daughter.
Anyway, and sometimes
the owner would try to stop a fight, and it was (?
?, laughs), it was horrible, it was awful.
But you could play anything you want.
And that was an important place, because it was
in Yokohama.
Yokohama had a (military) camp.
Thats where Hampton Hawes was.
And not only that, there was Hal Stein, who later on was with Charles, Ray Ch..., not
Ray Charles, uh, the vibraphone player, the Teddy Charles....

478
Brown:
479
 Teddy Charles.

480
Akiyoshi:
481
 ...group.
And Buddy (Walter) Benton, who no one knew (in) those days, but
played really good, you know.
And he was the one who used to show me the tunes, like
Indiana.
" I didnt know the tune, its like, "Back home Indiana," all those tunes I
learned from what we called "Saig-san," you know, he looked like Saig (Takamori,
famous samurai leader of the Meiji Restoration)-san .
So, that was a very important place
for me and uh, everything, anything.... And also, going home, Id stop at Chigusa and
listen to records and (have) coffee, and so on and so on.
And that was very, very, you
know, important.
Before that, I have to mention about 53, 1953 I already had my own
group, as I said, sometimes (wed) get a job, I dont have a job, and then I would just be
by) myself.
And there was a very popular group called Six Joes.

482
Brown:
483
 Six Joes.

484
Akiyoshi:
485
 Six Joes.
And there was, uh, the leader was a bass player named Shin
Watanabe.
He later on formed Watanabe Productions, the production (company).
If it
werent for that production (company), you couldnt have any television program,
something like that.
It really became... and he was a bass player, and he also died, but
the tenor player was one of the best, actually, probably one of the two best tenor players,
this one we used to call "Sleepy," because he looked like he was sleeping all the time.
It
was Matsumoto ... maybe, I dont quite remember ... Hidehiko.
Hidehiko Matsumoto.
And he was a tenor player, and he was a very, very counted player.
And there was a
vibraphone player, then there was ... anyway, Six Joes, so it was the most popular group.

Then, 1953, the first live house, jazz club in Tokyo, and....

486
Brown:
487
 Live house?

488
Akiyoshi:
489
 Yeah, live house, the first one.
Um....

490
Brown:
491
 Where was it in Tokyo?

492
Akiyoshi:
493
 Theyre called "live houses" in Japan.

494
Brown:
495
 Where was it in Tokyo?
What section?

496
Akiyoshi:
497
 West, Ginza.
Ginza, nana-chme, roku-chme (city block 7 or 6), second one,
roku-chme (block 6).
Ginza is seven chme, but the second one, and the west side of the
main street.
Main street of Ginza, west side, and uh.... (It) opened October 15.
The man
asked the Six Joes, you know, Watanabe-san, to play the (opening) night, and there was a
charge of music, another was, he was ... daytime.
So he came to me--he always liked
my playing--and he said, "You get the best ones you want to get," you know, maybe like
a quintet to play in the daytime.
I played from, like, 12 to 6 or something.
And he
Watanabe) played from 7 to 11, something like that, I dont know ... Im not quite sure
of accurate hours, daytime.
I had an evening, already had a job, and I had a quartet, and
thats the first time Sadao Watanabe, who is very famous today, he was maybe 18 years
old, and I had him.
He was the first one who sounded like a bebop player.
He sounded
very much like Jackie McLean, that kind of sound, you know.
Anyway, so ... when
Shin) Watanabe-san asked me to do it, Sadao Watanabe was a little bit too ... its not
quite, quite ... so at that time there was a more established alto player and there was
another tenor player who played very well, Miyazawa, Akira Miyazawa, who was also
very a good player and had a quintet in the daytime.
So, November 3, I dont remember,
 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, or 3, 4, 5, I dont remember, but three days, Norman Granz brought
JATP (Jazz at the Philharmonic) to Japan and played the Nichigeki, which no longer
exists, but in Yrakuch.
This was the first group that came to Japan to play for a
Japanese audience.
Before that, there was, I said, Oscar Pettifords group, and the Gene
Krupa Trio was there, and actually, Satchmos group was there, too.
But they were all
USO tours.

498
Brown:
499
 USO tours.

500
Akiyoshi:
501
 So, this was the first one.
And, uh, Oscar Petersons trio, and Ella Fitzgerald,
you know, and all these ... Flip Phillips, Ben Webster, I think was there, I dont know.
But Roy Eldridge, and Charlie Shavers, I think.
But, anyway, they came and played.
And someone brought--I wish I know who that is, because I couldnt possibly, how I can
thank him, I dont know, but (he was) Japanese, I know--he brought Oscar Peterson and


Flip Phillips to this live house when I was playing.
And we ... so he listened to (me) a
bit and came to me while I was playing and said, "Are you playing somewhere tonight?
"
and I said, "Yes, Im playing dah-dah-dah-dah," and he said, "Okay, Ill come again,
because I have to go to work now.
" Then he came again (in the) evening, to a place that
was called Club New Ginza, it was mostly for the Americans, and it was kind of like a ...
balcony, stairs, you know.
And he came and he listened and he played, too, he played,
too.
And he said, "I want you to come at three oclock to the hotel," and I said .... And
he ... told Granz, he said, "You should record her.
" Thats how my recording came, you
know.
And ... this is also like, say, luck was involved, I think, in timing, because if the
live house wasnt open, he would not have (had) an opportunity to listen to me.
So
everything is kind of timing, you know.
So I consider myself very lucky that the place
was open at that time and that I was asked by Watanabe-san to have my group play, you
know, quote-unquote "all-star," you know (chuckles), quintet, whatever it is.
So,
everything I think had a lot to do with timing, and luck was involved, you know.

502
Brown:
503
 Before we go on to your recording, um, who else was in the rhythm section of
your quintet, this "all-star" quintet?

504
Akiyoshi:
505
 Youre talking of ... my ...?

506
Brown:
507
 The one that you got together....

508
Akiyoshi:
509
 Oh, there was a ... drummer and bass player were from my quartet....

510
Brown:
511
 From your quartet?

512
Akiyoshi:
513
 My quartet, yes....

514
Brown:
515
 So who were the original personnel of your quartet, your first group?

516
Akiyoshi:
517
 Quartet is ... Jun Kawaguchi--he also died, he was a young man, but--he was
then a bass player.
We used to call (him) "Omasuzu," thats his nickname.
And he
couldnt really understand, you know, the things ...
I had to write it, all the notes, so its
the kind of right notes to play....

518
Brown:
519
 So you had to write out all the walking bass (lines)?
Everything?
(laughs)

520
Akiyoshi:
521
 Yeah, all the walking bass, cause he wasnt a walking bass player.
I dont
really know how many walking bass players existed in those days, you know.
But, uh, at
least there was somebody--Watanabe-san was (one of them)--they understand the
chord) changes and so on.
This man didnt quite understand everything.
So ... and I
had my particular way I wanted to hear.
I didnt want to hear certain notes.
So I,


consequently I had to write all the notes (laughs).

522
Brown:
523
 (Laughs) You have to write everything you want to hear!

524
Akiyoshi:
525
 Yeah, right, exactly.
So, that was a ... so everything, I think, all had to do
with the timing.

526
Brown:
527
 Yeah, absolutely.
So ... Oscar Peterson recommends to Norman Granz that he
should record you.
So then what happens?
So you met Norman Granz, at this point?
Yeah.

528
Akiyoshi:
529
 Yes, I met ... he said, "I usually listen to a player before I record it, but Oscar
said that I dont have to listen to you.
We have to go to Hong Kong, but a week later
well) come back, so you select the music by that time," and so on.
And, uh, we
recorded from midnight, "Ill give you Oscars rhythm section," which was that ... and of
course Oscar didnt have drummer, so JATP--in Oscars trio there wasnt any
drummer--so JATP had, J.C. Herd was the drummer.
So J.C. Herd, and Herb Ellis, and
Ray Brown, that was the rhythm section.

530
Brown:
531
 So how was that?

532
Akiyoshi:
533
 I dont really remember, I think I was like this (probably makes a face), of
course.

534
Brown:
535
 (Laughs)

536
Akiyoshi:
537
 I really didnt think I could play, you know.
But once we started playing it
was okay.
But ... he would say, "Play six choruses," like that, and I have no problem
playing those--I used to play 20 minutes, wah-wah-wah-wah, you know.
And, uh ... one
thing about the Norman Granz recording is that--I didnt think about it in those days, but
later on I thought about--now, who am I?
Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, you know, J.C. Herd,
I mean they were like real giants of jazz players.
They have nothing to play; Norman
wouldnt let them take any solos or nothing.
Its all piano.
All piano.
Thats the way he
liked to record.
So, he liked to record someone, if hes featuring somebody, he features
somebody, thats it.
If you notice about Oscar Peterson trio recordings, its pretty much
like that, you know.

538
Brown:
539
 Feature the, yeah....

540
Akiyoshi:
541
 Yeah, thats how....

542
Brown:
543
 Well, Im looking at the discography entry for your ... Amazing Toshiko


Akiyoshi.
Thats the title of the record (laughs).

544
Akiyoshi:
545
 Is it?
No, Amazing, I dont think that was the one, though.
I think the first one
was a 10-inch (LP), the pink ... the cover, (there was) a flower coming out of the piano.

546
Brown:
547
 Hmm (chuckles).

548
Akiyoshi:
549
 Is that what it says, Amazing?

550
Brown:
551
 Well, thats what it is in this, this is the Tom Lord discography.
It has the listing
of tunes.
First tune that is listed is "Toshikos Blues.
"

552
Akiyoshi:
553
 See, that is Norman's fault.

554
Brown:
555
 (Laughs)

556
Akiyoshi:
557
 Because that is a Bud ... a Bud ... (sings) da-da-da-da-da-dahh, Bud played
that one.

558
Brown:
559
 Uh-huh.

560
Akiyoshi:
561
 I think its called "Buds Blues" (composed by Sonny Stitt).
But probably he
didnt copyright it.

562
Brown:
563
 Ahh.

564
Akiyoshi:
565
 So Norman gave me credit, which I got ... you know, I needed that like a hole
in the head, everybody thinks I stole it.
But I had nothing to do with anything.
That was
really a drag.

566
Brown:
567
 So did you pick all the tunes, all the tunes that were recorded?

568
Akiyoshi:
569
 Yes, yes.

570
Brown:
571
 So this is your repertoire, then.

572
Akiyoshi:
573
 Yes, yes.

574
Brown:
575
 And you have "Squatty Roo"....

576
Akiyoshi:
577
 Yes.


578
Brown:
579
 ... "Laura," "Shadrach," "I Want to be Happy," "What is this Thing Called
Love?
" What were ... so when you got ready to make this recording, can you describe
the process?
You have these other three, as you say, great jazz musicians.
So whats the
process?
You just get into the studio and just play, or did you rehearse, or did you talk
about the tunes?

580
Akiyoshi:
581
 No, we never rehearsed.
We just went there and played.
So he just ... he
didnt like to take many takes, Norman, you know.
Hed just say, "Play once," then he
would say, "You play six choruses," like that.
And some had a bridge--some music
doesnt have a bridge, but some tunes have a bridge--sometimes the bridge was taken by
the drummer or something like that.
But other than that, there was no one, no one played
solos.

582
Brown:
583
 How was the feeling with the other musicians, how...?

584
Akiyoshi:
585
 Oh, they were very supportive.
Of course, they knew how nervous I was, you
know.
So ... they were very, very, very supportive.
Im grateful for that.
And its just
uh ...
I dont really remember anything, because I really nervous, and I was like that.
But, I was playing a lot before that, you know, before this happened, so I had no problem
playing, and once youre playing its fine, but before youre playing, you get really
nervous.
But it was, you know ... so, it went like that and.... Lew, sometime, a long
time ago, first time he listened to that record, he said, "Boy, you used to play very fast!
"
chuckles)

586
Brown:
587
 (Laughs)

588
Akiyoshi:
589
 Yeah, I used to play very fast (chuckles).

590
Brown:
591
 I know that you mentioned, you know, the lineage of Teddy Wilson and Bud
Powell.
What about Art Tatum?
Does he figure in?

592
Akiyoshi:
593
 Art Tatum was something that was ... when Norman Granz, after recording,
he went back to the States and he sent me tons of Art Tatums (records), because he
recorded for (Granz), so he sent them to me.
And ... his recording ... actually, frankly
speaking, I neglected to say, but I heard his record before that, playing, uh, "Begin the
Beguine.
" And, uh, I think it was, I heard it at a jazz coffee shop, and it was really
amazing technique, the way ... and I think I sort of was....
But also, I heard "Elegy.
"
This is a masterpiece.
I mean, I ... Im not the only one: apparently Norman Gran...
I
mean, excuse me, Oscar Peterson really thought so.
I understand he used to play that,
you know.
I have no chops to play that, but I mean, Oscar has and he used to play that all
the time.
And Ray Brown used to kid him and say, "Hey, hey, Oscar," you know,
Tatum is here!
" And he would say, "Oo-oo," and stop or something.
It made him feel


like that, (so) Tatum must have been really great.
I didnt get to hear him in person.
But
most recordings, it was really ...
I was amazed (at) his ability, and he would play one
after another, and if I know Norman Granz, he probably didnt have a take two,
everything blah, blah, blah, and it was so many standard tunes and so on.
But, it didnt
really hit my heart.
The one who hit (my) heart was Bud Powell.
He was the one, you
know, who really hit my heart.
He not only had enormous technique--later I learned that
he was actually classically trained, which I didnt know that--but his ... his ... uh ...
actuation, he had a very unique way of accenting a certain beat.
It was a very ... his
own.
Although hes not exactly a smooth player, he was really ... and he was real
dynamic.
But he also ... he was another tree, family tree from Tatum.
He came out
directly from Charlie Parker, so hes basically the first bebop player, so he played very
much, his early ... if you listen, its very much like Charlie Parker, except he doesnt
have to breathe, you know.

594
Brown:
595
 (Laughs)

596
Akiyoshi:
597
 But he had ... and I really love the way he played ballads.
He was such, hes
got such a male romance and inborn ability, and I always thought, (swooning voice) "Oh,
beautiful, ahhhh!
" (chuckles)

598
Brown:
599
 (Chuckles) So were you happy with the recording once you heard it back, your
first recording?
I mean, cause now this is your document.

600
Akiyoshi:
601
 No, I had no feeling whatsoever.

602
Brown:
603
 (Laughing) Just numb, huh?

604
Akiyoshi:
605
 Yeah.
All I know was, it sent me ... the review, I think it was Down Beat,
said I had three stars, which I think was pretty good, you know, first one.
And the cover
got five stars!
(laughs)

606
Brown:
607
 (Laughs) The flowers coming out of the piano?

608
Akiyoshi:
609
 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(laughs)

610
Brown:
611
, Okay, um, (recording engineer interrupts) ... okay, sure.
Break time.
Look, the
suns out!
Amazing!
....
Returning again.
While we were on break, we were talking
about the possibility of..., while Toshiko was performing in the clubs in Tokyo, its
entirely possible, my mother was a native of Tokyo, Shinagawa, and my father was
stationed there, and thats where they met, it was dancing in those service clubs.
Its
entirely possible that my parents met while Toshiko was performing (laughs)!


612
Akiyoshi:
613
 Yeah!
Its entirely possible (laughs).

614
Brown:
615
 I think thats extraordinary.
Um, Ill definitely have to tell my mom about that
laughs).
So ... youve done your first recording now, uh, youve gotten, this is your first
exposure in America, youve gotten a review by Down Beat.
So what happens next?

616
Akiyoshi:
617
 Nothing happens.

618
Brown:
619
 (Laughs)

620
Akiyoshi:
621
 (Laughs) Actually, after that, my life was the same as before: I was still barely
paying the rent, and so on and so on.
And, meanwhile, as I said before, there were a lot
of American troops were drafted and stationed in Japan, and one of the persons was from
Boston.
And his name was Tony Teixeira--I understand hes also deceased--but he was
a guitar player.
And he said, "You know, you should write a school, theres a Berklee
School of Music, and you should write, maybe they can bring you over to the States.
"
And I really wanted to go to the States, for the reason, cause Id been copying the music
from records and Im listening to players, and by 52 or 3, Id become sort of like the
biggest, you know, frog in a very small pond, so to speak.
And then I couldnt really ...
as you know, jazz is a social art: if you are surrounded by better players, you become
better at it.
So, at this particular point, maybe I was the biggest frog in a small pond, but I
was just starting.
I was just ... there were so many things that I wanted to be able to play
with these players whose records Id been listening to all the time.
And it would be great
if I went to the States, Id be able to play with them, Id be able to learn much more and
blah, blah, blah.
So, I had written a letter--Im sure it was terrible English (laughs)--but
I got (it) proofed by, it was the guitar player, Tony read it and he said, "Well, I guess its
okay," you know, "Its fine.
" And ... at almost the same time, thats when my record
came out, also, 1954, I believe, and so on.
So ... the school was like about 350 students,
its not like today.
And the founder was Lawrence Berk, Mister Berk was probably
looking for something to advertise the school, and uh, here comes the record, my record.
And in those days, if you said a Japanese plays jazz, it was like, something as if,
REALLY?
" You know, you couldnt believe from today.
Especially if it was a girl.
And its really like, uh ... and Norman Granz recorded it.
So there was a lot of reason
for people to maybe pay attention, what have you.
So the school, basically, gave me a
full scholarship (to) advertise the school.
And in those days you couldnt come to the
States unless you had a student visa or a working visa, one or the other.
And uh ...
I still
remember the student visa was called an F-form visa, something.
Anyway, that finalized
.. and in 56, January, I came to this country.
It was Pan-American number one.

622
Brown:
623
 (Chuckling) Okay.

624
Akiyoshi:
625
 Four-propeller engine.


626
Brown:
627
 How many days did it take?
I know when I first went to Japan it took three
days: first from San Francisco to Hawaii, then to Wake Island (laughs).
How long, what
was your trip?

628
Akiyoshi:
629
 You know, I cant remember, but Im sure there were bom, bom, bom (many
stops).
What I remember about it is that there was hardly anyone on the plane.

630
Brown:
631
 Mmm.

632
Akiyoshi:
633
 And it was three seats, three seats.
And I was ... also, stewardesses were very
kind, not like today.
Today its like army surgeon or something....
But they were very,
very kind, and there were just not many people.
That I remember.
And ... what I
remember is from, it was Los Angeles to Boston--Im sure it stopped many places--but
I was sleeping and I woke up one day, landed and take off and so on, blah, blah.
And I
got into Boston at two oclock in the morning, Sunday morning.
January, Im not quite
sure, 11th or 10th, somewhere around there.
But it was a long trip, I know.
But it was
very exciting to me.
Id never flown before, so... (chuckles).

634
Brown:
635
 I want to talk about your experience: at this time, was it still called Schillinger
House, or was it already called Berklee?

636
Akiyoshi:
637
 It was called Berklee School of Music, because Schillinger House--and Mrs.
Schillinger objected to that, to use the Schillinger name--so Mr. Berk changed it to
Berklee.
Lee was his son, who is already retired.
When I went to school he was a little
boy.
And uh ... so Berk-lee School of Music.

638
Brown:
639
 Um, Im going to return us back to Japan, because there was something that was
written about you and your days in Japan, in Hampton Hawes autobiography....

640
Akiyoshi:
641
 Ah, ah, ah.

642
Brown:
643
 ...called Raise Up Off Me.
And page 62, hes talking about, he was talking to a
woman, a Japanese woman, and she says, "Ill take you to the Harlem Club, wheres
theres a girl, Toshiko, plays like Bud Powell.
" So, um, the Harlem Club, could you talk
about that?
Do you remember the Harlem Club?

644
Akiyoshi:
645
 Well, what I remember is that there was a bass player called Nabil Totah.

646
Brown:
647
 Uh-huh, "Knobby" Totah, yeah, yeah.
Arabian.

648
Akiyoshi:
649
 He was active ... it was Yokohamas, stationed in Yokohama, Im not quite....


Either 293rd Army Band, or 289th Army Band, I dont know which one, which.
But it
was ... he told me, said, "You know, Hampton Hawes is coming.
We are trying to get
him into our camp.
" So, to make the story short, so he came.
And, those days we had a
lot of sessions, jam sessions at night.
So he came to sessions.
And, as you know, he was
very sick, and he would play, and that was my first meeting with Hamp, was that session,
that time.
Then it was ... his job was in the Army Band, because there was no piano--
those days, the boats came in to the harbor at Yokohama that the band had to play for,
and his job was to play cymbals (laughs).

650
Brown:
651
 (Laughs)

652
Akiyoshi:
653
 I dont know how well he played the cymbals, but that was his job.
And uh, at
that time I mentioned that I was playing at the Yokohama Seamens Club, so he used to
come down and I asked him to play and he would play.
And I would listen to him play
and try to learn a lot, as much as I could.
It was because, you know, probably the first
noted musician as far as ... because before that there was Shelly Manne, I think it was
Shorty Rogers, probably was the leader, the writer.
They called them something "Giants"
Shorty Rogers and His Giants) or something, something, an L.A. band, it was a group.
They played and Hamp played a solo ...
I dont quite remember the tune (sings),
something like that, you know.
And he had such a crispy way of playing, you know, his
touch was very crispy, it was very, his own.
It was fantastic, and so here is the person I
heard on the record, and here he is in Yokohama, and I tried to learn as much as I could.
It was a pity, the fact that he was very sick while he was in the camp, still.
So he had a
lot of problems, you know.
He was probably one of the sweetest men that I probably
have met.
And in later years--much later, much later--and I was in an apartment that
was in Greenwich Village, 10th street, and he got an engagement at the, uh, the Village
Vanguard, for two weeks.
And it was very ... he hadnt played in New York in a long,
long, long time, and he came to visit me, and he had a new recording, with strings
Hampton Hawes Plays Movie Musicals, recorded 1969).
And he came to visit me, he
wanted to give it to me.
But he had his record in newspaper, to cover (it) up.
Now, most
players, they will show people, so that they can see it!
He was kind of like that; he was a
very sweet person, and he wasnt, you know, an aggressive person, and uh, he was a very
unique (in his) playing.
I think he influenced a lot of people and I am among those.
It
was great that he came to Yokohama!
(laughs)

654
Brown:
655
 Hm, well, he described seeing you, he said, and Im quoting: "...then this little
chick in a kimono (chuckles) sat down at the piano and started to rip off things I didnt
believe, swinging like shed grown up in Kansas City.
" So, you obviously made a big
impression on him, and then he goes on to discuss, he said that you guys became very,
very good friends, very close friends, and then he says that you went on to America and
made it big.
But he says he has--let me see if I can read it--uh, "Toshiko...," oh geez,
Im sorry....
Uh, he talks about a possibility of you two doing duets and what he says is


that it didnt happen.
Uh, "Later on she made it on her own in the States.
Anyway I soon
discovered she dug me for myself and we developed a lasting friendship.
The American
consulate arranged for us to play a concert together and the response was so good, they
contacted the Army to see about sending us on tour--Toshiko in her kimono, me in my
slick American uniform--figuring it might help improve relations between the two
countries, which were touchy at the time with the occupation still on.
But somebody
squashed the idea...." So....

656
Akiyoshi:
657
 Oh, I didnt know that.
Oh, what a pity.
He didnt tell me.
But that wouldve
been great, a great experience for me.
He was a really, really unfortunate person, died
very young.

658
Brown:
659
 Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so I wanted to make sure we covered that, since he did talk
about you.
I think this is one of the few accounts of somebody actually seeing you
performing in Japan.
So, now youre in America (laughs), youre in Boston, of all
places!

660
Akiyoshi:
661
 Yeah, Im in Boston, right.

662
Brown:
663
 Now youre taking lessons.
So talk about what it was like being in that school,
and taking lessons, and who the teachers were, et cetera.

664
Akiyoshi:
665
 Well, first, as I said before, I landed at two oclock in the morning, Sunday
morning.
And uh, three men, the first time I met: it was George Wein, uh, the founder,
Lawrence Berk, then George Weins Newport festivals public relations person, called
Harry Paul.
Those three people came to greet me at the airport.
Then, I learned that
evening was the Bud Powell Trios last day at Storyville, and I said, "Boy, thats
something!
"

666
Brown:
667
 (Laughs)

668
Akiyoshi:
669
 The day I landed, that was his last day.
And Edward Thigpen was the
drummer, who was drafted and was in the Korean War and he had a relief and came to
Tokyo and sat in.
See, the jazz world is very small, and so anybody who was drafted in
Tokyo, whatever it is, in Japan, theyd say, "If you go to Tokyo, if you seek for her
group, you can sit in and play.
" So thats the way itd always been.
So most of the
people who came they always kind of let me know they were there, and Ed was one of
those and he sat in and played.
So, I knew he was with Bud, and he was there with Bud
Powell, and I really thought that was something.
And, as far as the school is concerned,
uh ... my problem was that I really didnt speak the language that well.
But, the good
thing about music is that, its not like studying English literature, so.... (laughs) That was
.. but most of the time ... the one that I started from first, at the very beginning, which I


know just about anything that they had to tell me.
The only things that I didnt know was
the Schi-- ... also they used to teach the Schillinger System.
They dont do that today,
but thats something that I didnt know, so.... To some degree that was very helpful to
me and it was ... it kind of accumulated my knowledge a little bit about certain
relationships between music and mathematics and what have you.
So on, so on.

670
Brown:
671
 So you already felt comfortable with music theory?
Youd already ... basically
taught yourself music theory?

672
Akiyoshi:
673
 Yes.
So ... but, what they ... if you know about music history--Im sure you
do--but, the point is, the theory comes after the composition, always.
So modern theory
and traditional theory is different.
Music was so ... theory is, put a very simple way, is
analyzing what happened in music, and make a theory out of it, which is not exactly, you
know, exactly, in my mind.
So it doesnt matter.
If you are a musically oriented person,
you learn by yourself and it still ends up musically.
And if you studied, youre not a
musical person, no matter how much you studied, you will not be able to create music.
Music is something like ... painting is the same thing.
Its good to have the knowledge,
but you dont have to have it.
Thats what I think.

674
Brown:
675
 Okay.
Before we continue with the school, I want to go back and talk about you
seeing Bud Powell...,

676
Akiyoshi:
677
 Yes.

678
Brown:
679
 ... because I wanna know what ... did you meet him?
Did you talk to him?

680
Akiyoshi:
681
 No, I was ... yeah, you know, because I knew Ed.
So Ed, at the intermission
time, Ed came to me and said, "Why dont you sit in?
" you know.
And at this time--it
was a propeller (plane), so, I dont know, maybe three days or whatever it is, left for
departure--I hadnt played piano for probably like four days or something.
And uh, I sat
in, I think I probably played "I Remember April" or something like that--thats what I
think--but Im sure I didnt really play that well, because as I said, you know, I hadnt
played the piano.
But I heard Bud Powell laughing his head off behind me, and I finished
and I ... he took all, a deep bow.
He took a deep bow.
And ... this I have to mention:
later on--and there was something about Bud Powell, I had some degree of, uh,
something--because when I played in Philadelphia, in a place called Showboat, with a
trio, he would play at the Band Box.
In those days there were quite a lot of jazz clubs in
Philadelphia, and they were walking distance (from each other).
He used to come down
and listen to me.
And hed forget to go back to his job.
And he had a bodyguard,
because he was, you know, he had a problem and so on.
And, before that, it was even,
uh, the Hickory House, sometimes hed play at Birdland, and he would come to listen to
me.
And uh, same thing, you know, hed forget to go back, but....
The reason he was


listening to me was not the same reason I would listen to him or any other people.
Those
days, I would listen so I could learn something.
His case was ... he heard somebody
playing, obviously had (his) influence--and especially in those days, I played like Bud
Powell--and "Here (is someone who) obviously got a lot of influence from me, and its
somewhere that I havent been.
" Now, today a jazz musician goes to Japan maybe every
few months or what have you.
But the first jazz group (that) went--outside of Jazz at the
Philharmonic--was in 1961, Art Blakey, in January.
This was the first one.
After that,
you know, there were many groups.
But, so--Im talking about 56, 57, 58--no one
had) been in Japan and naturally he hadnt, and obviously he felt comfort, I think,
because he had a very difficult life.
Um, I read a book written by a Frenchman, and all
these things led me to believe he had a very difficult time.
And uh, it would comfort him,
I think, you know.
So he used to come listen to ... one time, he came to Hickory House,
he came and I asked him to sit in and he (??
), then he went upstairs--there was an
upstairs inside the bar--he played a little bit.
That was nice.
But its always something
.. then of course later on, he moved to Paris in 1958, and I got my first job at the Blue
Note in Paris in 1964.
Uh, April, "April in Paris"--it was nothing like that, though.
Cold
laughs).
Anyway, he had tuberculosis and he was in a sanitarium under the care of
Francis, Francis Paudras.
He would come, Sunday he would go to Francis loft and
Francis would take him back on Monday, or something like that.
But he ...
I think he
really wanted to go home, and finally he went back to the States.
But, because Francis
knew that I was kind of a disciple of Bud, he had my recording, the one ... uh ... the
Storyville recording (The Toshiko Trio, 1956), with some of my compositions.
One is
called "Studio J" (on The Many Sides of Toshiko, 1957).
Thats the room where we used
to learn, you know, tunes, Studio J.
And Bud listened to that and he said, "Did you write
that?
" and I said, "Yes," and he said, "Youre the best female piano player.
" He said that
to me, and that would carry me for a long time; when I had a hard time, almost quit, Id
say, "Well, Bud Powell said that, so I must have something," or something.
But, because
of that, I wanted to form the big band, because Lew wanted to do something, you know,
not (that) I wanted to have a big band, so my job was to write the music, and thats why I
have "Studio J" orchestrated.
Many bands like that.
They especially like the shout
chorus.
So I have quite fond memories of Bud.
I feel like its really karma, the fact that
he always seemed to be playing when I was playing there.
And it was ... the first time I
heard him in person, it wasnt like, uh, you know, his prime time, but it was amazing that
.. to ... not ... like almost like automatically moving, you know.
Im sure he practiced a
lot, you know, when he was in his young days, otherwise it wouldnt be like that.
And I
heard, uh, some tapes made in Paris, and it was this incredibly fast Bach tune (sings), so
he had things in the head and, uh, every once in a while that came out.
What I
understand, altogether four times he had electric shock treatment, which is not exactly
kosher, I dont think.
He had a really difficult time, I think.

682
Brown:
683
 Well, were gonna return to your experience at Berklee, but Im looking at the
discography, and its listing as your second recording The Toshiko Trio, and its Paul


Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

684
Akiyoshi:
685
 Yeah.

686
Brown:
687
 ... and this says its Storyville, Boston, recorded in Boston, 1954.
Is that
correct?

688
Akiyoshi:
689
 No, New York.

690
Brown:
691
 New York.
But it was in the States in 1954?

692
Akiyoshi:
693
 Ye--19, no, not 54....

694
Brown:
695
 Should be later.

696
Akiyoshi:
697
 56, I think.

698
Brown:
699
 Should be 56.
So, we should get in touch with Tom Lord and let him know.
Okay.

700
Akiyoshi:
701
 56, I dont know, George Wein was at that time music director, A&R man for
Storyville recordings.
So, we did two recordings in New York.
One was (with) Paul
Chambers--Miles had some kind of problem with his throat, and they werent working--
so Paul Chambers and Ed.
Another one was with Roy Haynes and Oscar Pettiford.
Ooh,
that was really something.
Yes.

702
Brown:
703
 (Chuckles) Yeah.
Well, the discography continues with several other recordings
in Japan....

704
Akiyoshi:
705
 Yes.

706
Brown:
707
 ... but well come back to that, maybe tomorrow.
But I want to continue on,
since were already at Berklee, so to go ahead and talk more about ... you said that you
got there, youre taking lessons, you already were familiar with a lot of the....

708
Akiyoshi:
709
 Yes, already I knew, but one thing about the--I think the Japanese, they dont
say anything, I mean, I didnt--that year, there was a Jazz at the Philharmonic that came
to the Symphony Hall, and Norman Granz told Oscar, Oscar Peterson came to see me,
and he said, "You should be playing, not (be) in a school," you know.
And uh ... and he
was very nice to me, and I probably wouldve liked to do that.
But I came with a full
scholarship and I didnt have enough heart to do that.
So, I guess it was a ... sometimes I
wonder if I wouldve liked ... most of the students came, especially from Europe,


someone like Joe Zawinul, somebody like that came to Berklee, then you know, got out
very quick, very fast and so on, so on.
But.
I dont think he came with a scholarship.
In
my case, you know, I felt like I had an obligation.
So that was ... and sometimes I
wonder about if Id got out and if I were playing, I wonder if Id have been a more, you
know, noted pianist, whom everybody would look for, as some kinds of pianists were.
But at the same time, I think probably I wouldnt be writing, or whatever it is, you know.
I think everything worked out the way it was supposed to work out.
So that was, so I
wasnt ... but I really wanted to get out.
My reason for getting out was to get the diploma
from, I mean, to get the Schillinger test passed, so thats what I did three years later, and I
got out of the school in three and half years, so....
But most of the time I was, like ... for
example, summertime, uh, there were six weeks, and sometimes I was at the Hickory
House, and the first year, I was playing with a trio, which was, at that time at the school
there was Jake Hanna--a great drummer who lives in Los Angeles--and uh, Gene
Cherico, who was a wonderful, wonderful bass player, who died quite some time ago.
But, uh ... trio, we used to travel and go to different places.
And it was 57, 58 we were
at the Hickory House for four, you know, six weeks or so.
So mostly I was playing, (??
)
hours or more (a week) of playing, playing different places, so on.

710
Brown:
711
 So this recording, The Toshiko Trio, that was George Wein?
That was George
Weins session?

712
Akiyoshi:
713
 Yes, George Weins session.

714
Brown:
715
 And ... do you remember much about that session?
You had, you know, Paul
Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

716
Akiyoshi:
717
 No, the material, was all ...
I chose.
What I remember about it was, I had
written a thing called, uh, "Lazy Day.
" It was a lazy day, Sunday afternoon, so it was
Lazy Day.
" It has, like, a little bridge, it has a little, the bass had to play certain things,
you know.
And Paul Chambers went duduladah, and he said, "Lemme try to figure out
the fingering," and went bru-bru-bru the second time, and I said "Wha--!
" you know.

718
Brown:
719
 (Laughs)

720
Akiyoshi:
721
 "Wow, hes really, really good.
" Thats what I remember.
My only regret is
at that time, Norman Granz actually offered to record a duet with Ray Brown, that hed
rather I came (t)here.
But in order to do that I had to fly to Los Angeles, and the school
rejected that, so I couldnt do that.
That was ... there are two things that I really regret,
because the school didnt give me the permission to do.
This is one.
Another one was
Oscar Pettiford, when we recorded that year, you know ... Oscar had, before I left Japan,
Oscar had two recordings of kind of large ensembles, which was kind of unusual: two
French horns, and he was playing the cello, and so on.
And uh ... theres some harp, and


it was kind of interesting music (reissued on the CD Deep Passion).
He had a two-week
engagement at Birdland, and he offered me a job to be the piano player.
And then, the
school rejected that.
The reason was, if I were to play in New York I had to be the first, I
had to be the leader, or something like that.
I didnt want to be a leader and somehow I
was pushed into (being) a leader.
I wasnt ...
I like, I would be the happiest person if I
were a great sideman, side player.

722
Brown:
723
 (Chuckles)

724
Akiyoshi:
725
 And uh ... that was ... but, I guess everything worked out the way it worked
out.
I learned a lot of things about being a leader.
So, thats okay.

726
Brown:
727
 There are some very interesting titles on this LP.
You have "Soshu no yora,"
and....

728
Akiyoshi:
729
 "Sosh no yoru.
"

730
Brown:
731
 They mustve misspelled it.

732
Akiyoshi:
733
 "Sosh no yoru" is a Japanese pop tune (composed by Saij Yaso and Niki
Kitao).
Pop music.
"Sosh" is the name of a place in China (Szhu).
Yoru is
evening," as you know.
"Evening of Sosh," thats how its supposed to be.

734
Brown:
735
 (Chuckles) Okay.
And then you have "Kysh"?

736
Akiyoshi:
737
 Hmm?

738
Brown:
739
 Another one called "Kysh"?

740
Akiyoshi:
741
 "Kysh.
" Kysh is like a nostalgic, you know, nostalgic ... uh, for where
you came from, youre kind of a little homesick.
Little bit homesick, its kind of like
that.

742
Brown:
743
 And then "Homework.
" I dont know, was that a...?

744
Akiyoshi:
745
 Huh?

746
Brown:
747
 Called "Homework" (chuckles), "Homework.
"

748
Akiyoshi:
749
 "Homework"?

750
Brown:
751
 Yes, so (chuckles) maybe somebody else took liberties with the titles.
Or maybe


somebody needs to redo this (discography) (laughs).

752
Akiyoshi:
753
 No, that "Groove for Toshiko" is not the same thing, as that one.

754
Brown:
755
 Oh, the other one.
See this is actually, this is the real title....

756
Akiyoshi:
757
 This actually, uh....

758
Brown:
759
 I think what Im trying to highlight here is that youre composing, so, several
compositions, but well talk about that later in the interview, your process of
composition, et cetera.
But the fact that, you know, you have several originals on this
session, so....

760
Akiyoshi:
761
 Yeah, right.
I think its, I started writing because, when I came to Boston I
used to, of course, I used to go every night to listen, and in those days like, uh, even the
big bands, like Dukes band or Basies band, would stay for two weeks, you know, at a
club.
You cant think of that today, but....
I was always sitting in, I decided that when I,
if somebody asked me to sit in, I was going to sit in.
You know, I decided that.
So, I
used to sit in with, Max (Roach) would let me sit in, Miles would let me sit in, so on, so
on.
So ... but Diz had a big band in those days, and Phil Woods was, I think, lead alto,
and uh, Melba Liston was playing trombone.
Anyway, uh, I was sitting in, playing, and I
heard, "Powell!
Powell!
" When I played people said, "Aw, shes Bud Powell!
Shes
Bud Powell!
" And I started thinking, I said, "I guess thats no good, I have to, you know,
to try to find my own idiosyncrasy.
" One of the (reasons) I started writing, one of the
things that, I think, thats the reason I started writing, to develop my own idiosyncrasy.
So writing was something I was never interested in before.

762
Brown:
763
 Was your experience at Berklee, did it, um, uh ... highlight or advance this
compositional impetus of yours?
Did it help you in any way, or...?

764
Akiyoshi:
765
 I think it helped me to reorganize my thoughts.
But, I used to have ... you see,
before that, I came to this country, in Japan I had a nonet for the broadcast only.
For the
.. NHK had a jazz program....

766
Brown:
767
 We didnt talk about that.
Maybe we should....

768
Akiyoshi:
769
 Yeah, so ...
I had a nonet.
Those days I was influenced by, like, having a
good French horn player, you know, things like that.
And uh ... there werent any
Japanese French horn players that I knew of, so I had an American, uh, French horn
player who had been drafted.
We used to record at midnight for three programs, taping,
so on, so on, and I was, used to write.
Also, it was trial-and-error writing, you know, I
never learned to write.
But some of them worked out okay, and so on.
And uh, so I was


writing before I came to this country.
So, when I had this orchestration class with Herb
Pomeroy, and he said, "Well, youre not supposed to do this yet!
" you know, he said
things like that.

770
Brown:
771
 (Laughs)

772
Akiyoshi:
773
 (Laughs) So, uh ... it helped me to reorganize what I did.
I did ... in other
words, if I were to teach, that wouldve helped.
You know, I have no interest, but if I
were to teach, that was organizing your, in other words, organizing, systemize, and that
would help (me) teach.
But, as I said before, music, its not necessary to have all that, uh,
all that knowledge and all that.
Its good to have knowledge, I think, but, it doesnt have
to.

774
Brown:
775
 Who were some of the other students that you were in classes with?
You
mentioned several profe--, uh, teachers....

776
Akiyoshi:
777
 Yes.
Gene Cherico.
He was, he had a natural ear.
He used to be a drummer.
And when he was in the service he got in a car accident that hit a train, and he almost lost
his life.
So anyway, he, the arm, the surgeon took a bone from (his) hip and replaced the
arm, and he suggested he play the bass, pull the bass, to help (recover).
Thats how he
became a bass player.
So, Im not saying because of that, but he had a natural beat, he
was really a ... you know, but he had a tremendous ear.
He didnt know much about
theory.
And uh, sometimes Id ask, "How do these changes go?
" and hed say, "Well, I
dont know, I play a B-flat and I..." (laughs).
And Jake always had a beautiful sound; he
knew how to tune the drums, he was just fantastic that way.
I mean, he still probably is.
And uh ... so we had a very good time, you know, playing together.
And that was a good
.. there was a young player, at that time he was eighteen years (old) or something.
Im
not quite sure, there were two of them, one was called Jimmy Mosher, alto player--I
think later on maybe he played in Woody Hermans band or something.
But anyone was,
when I was in school, there werent any ... (tiredly) uh, God ... the most students were
on the G.I.
Bill, so they were not exactly, you know, little children.
They were on the G.I
Bill and a lot of them already were professionals.
But there werent that many jazz
players; I think it was mostly players in the big bands or something like that.
Herb
Pomeroy had a big band at school.
Later on, he had a recording called Band in Boston,
two of them (the other being Life is a Many Splendored Gig).
It was a very good band.
Great writing came from Jaki Byard--boy, he could write!
And uh, it was a very
exciting band, so I used to listen, every Monday night they played and I used to listen to
that.
But all the other times I went to Storyville (laughs).
And learning the tunes, it was
Studio J and that was on the first floor, a large room, and we had to learn tunes, (chord)
changes, and things like that.
You know.

778
Brown:
779
 Was there a piano teacher there or...?


780
Akiyoshi:
781
 Pardon?

782
Brown:
783
 Piano teacher?
Was there a piano teacher?

784
Akiyoshi:
785
 Oh, yes!
When I went to school, Mister Lawrence Berk arranged for me to
have piano lessons with Madame (Margaret) Chaloff, who was the mother of Serge
Chaloff.
And she was the student of a famous piano teacher, Madame Van Guelph
sp??).
And she was teaching at Boston University, so I had to go there to have a lesson.
But, she was wonderful because she taught me, more than anything, she taught me how to
practice.
That was (??).
But the school really wanted me to become like a, you know,
virtuoso player, because I had to play--I remember, there was Cacciatore, I think, it was
concerto, I think it was--anyway, I was struggling trying to play it.
And I had to play for
Arthur Fiedler in daytime (chuckles).
Arthur Fiedler said, "You shouldnt be so like that,
you should be (coos), walk out a little bit, look at the sky," you know, blah, blah, blah,
things like that.
But uh ...
I really wanted to be at Birdland, first of all, you know.
I
wanted to play at Birdland, but the school wanted me to play at the Hickory House,
because that had more merit or something, for pianists.
Maybe they paid better, I dont
know (laughs).
But all those Birdland things, I could do that after I left school.
And at
that time (my) manager was Oscar Woodstein, he was the manager, Oscar Woodstein.
Later on, I learned from Francis book that he was Bud Powells manager, which I didnt
know that.
And Oscar Woodstein hired me quite often, (for) which (Im) really grateful.
And I have no way of knowing the reason, but I suspect--after I read Francis book, that
he was the manager (for Powell)--that ...
Bud left the States in 1958, so I think maybe
I) reminded him of Bud.
Maybe, maybe thats why he hired me all the time or
something.
In those days, two groups, you know, so I didnt have to be (the) drawing
power.
I was able to be in Basies band and my trio, or sometimes it was Miles Davis
and my trio, things like that, so.... Pee Wee Marquette was the announcer and uh, he
would mispronounce my name.

786
Brown:
787
 How did he pronounce it?

788
Akiyoshi:
789
 I ... Tokisho or something.
I didnt know he was doing that purposely.
You
were supposed to give him money.
I didnt know that.
Gene Cherico told me, so I said,
Okay," so, and after that everything was okay.

790
Brown:
791
 (Laughs) Well, I wanted to ask you about, you know, you said that while you
were in Boston you got a chance to play with people because they were on extended
engagements.
You said you played with Miles and Max Roach.
What were those
experiences like?

792
Akiyoshi:
793
 Miles, he would let me sit in.
But when I went, he would lean on the piano


and hed watch me, my hands, like this, and I was like this (demonstrates nervousness),
you know.
And he said to me, "Are you nervous?
" I said, "Yes.
" He said, "Well, dont
be.
But I felt the same way with Bird.
" Thats what he told me.
Now, Miles was not
exactly the way people think, hes an evil guy, so on, so on.
But hes not exactly like
that, you know.
He was a nice man; I think it depended on whom he was speaking to, he
probably, thats what it was.
But, as I said, if I sat in hed say, "Powell!
Powell!
" you
know (chuckles).

794
Brown:
795
 (Laughing) Right.

796
Akiyoshi:
797
 And Max Roach was ... he always played, firstly, always incredibly fast.
That
was his style.
So, first day, it was the second day?
The pianist disappeared or something.
So there was a pianist living in Boston, called Joey Master, he was noted, I guess, so he
was subbing.
But he (Max) always played fast, so (chuckles) Joey came up to me and
said, he said, "You want to sit in?
" so I said (??
laughing).
Firstly, Max always played
fast.
And uh, the first time he had, uh ... Clifford (Brown) and, uh, Sonny Rollins....

798
Brown:
799
 And Richie.

800
Akiyoshi:
801
 Yes, Clifford (Richie) was ... uh, Buds brother.

802
Brown:
803
 Yeah, Richie Powell, right.

804
Akiyoshi:
805
 Yes.
And uh, anyway--I think it was George Moro on bass....

806
Brown:
807
 George Moro on bass, that was the, that was that quintet.

808
Akiyoshi:
809
 But Clifford Brown was ... if you met him, I was so surprised, because if you
met him on the street, you would never guess he was a jazz player.
He looked like a--
and he was so sane (serious) too, he was very sane--he couldve been an insurance
company (salesman) (laughs).
I think he was, Max was quite, quite ... attached to
Clifford, because when he died by car crash, he really was, Max was crushed, you know,
so.....
But that was the group.
Actually I had a photo in Birdland, I was sitting in--
somebody has it, anyway.
Max never said to me, "Shes Bud Powell," but Im sure....

810
Brown:
811
 Well, he had Richie!

812
Akiyoshi:
813
 Huh?

814
Brown:
815
 He had Richie, his brother, on piano!

816
Akiyoshi:
817
 Richie was ... what I understand is that Bud Powell taught Richie.
Bud was


actually formally trained and uh....

818
Brown:
819
 What did you think of Richies playing?
Did you hear him much?

820
Akiyoshi:
821
 Yeah, he played ... you know, played well, just like everybody else.
Actually,
I liked, I liked ... the first time when I was here, Miles group was Paul Chambers and
Red Garland, uh, Philly Joe (Jones).
That was something.
I really thought it was ... that
was like a modern, what do you call, Basies famous, you know, rhythm section, except
no guitar player.
But uh, it was really fantastic.

822
Brown:
823
 Was Coltrane in the group, too?

824
Akiyoshi:
825
 First Coltrane, then it was a short while, he was replaced by Sonny Rollins.
He was there briefly, then Coltrane (came) back.
But before Coltrane, after he (got) back
he would sit in a lot, and thats what the people know (as) Coltrane today.
But the first
Coltrane, when I heard, he was a little more like Sonny Stitt, kind of like that.
Except he
had his own little voice, you know; I mean his tone was a little bit different.
But he was
kind of a Sonny Stitt-type of player.

826
Brown:
827
 And you also had a chance to play with Roy Haynes, or sit in with Roy Haynes?

828
Akiyoshi:
829
 Oh, Roy didnt have a group.

830
Brown:
831
 Yeah, thats what I suspect, so....

832
Akiyoshi:
833
 He was working with Sarah Vaughan.
He was playing, backing for Sarah
Vaughan those days, so....
But he was voted (one of the) ten best-dressed men by
Esquire!

834
Brown:
835
 (Laughs) Esquire.

836
Akiyoshi:
837
 Oh, you know about that?
(laughs)

838
Brown:
839
 He and Miles, both.

840
Akiyoshi:
841
 He was a sharp dresser.

842
Brown:
843
 Still is!
(chuckles) Okay, well, I think probably this is a good time to stop....

844
Akiyoshi:
845
 Very good.

846
Brown:
847
 ... and we can move on after your Berklee experience.
But we want to pick up


with talking about Hickory House, how you got those engagements, and now you start
your real career (laughs).

848
Akiyoshi:
849
 (Modestly) Well, I dont know....

850
Brown:
851
 In America, at least.

852
Akiyoshi:
853
 Yeah.

854
Brown:
855
 Today is June 30th, 2008, and this is day two of the Smithsonian Jazz Oral
History interview with composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader Toshiko Akiyoshi, at her
home in Manhattan, New York.
Konnichi wa, Toshiko-san.

856
Akiyoshi:
857
 Konnichi wa.

858
Brown:
859
 So when I was making the introduction, you kind of made a grimace.
Did I not,
did I leave something out?
Composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader....

860
Akiyoshi:
861
 No, I think you said too much (laughs).

862
Brown:
863
 Too much (laughs).
But, um, these are your accomplishments; theyre very well
recorded, so we have to at least honor ... some of them, at least, so....

864
Akiyoshi:
865
 Thank you.

866
Brown:
867
 When we left off yesterday, we were talking about, you had just finished your
tenure at Berklee School, and you were now going to launch your professional career.
But, you know, you did talk about that you were already performing in Boston and also in
New York ... you played at Storyville?

868
Akiyoshi:
869
 Uh, Storyville, I started to play Storyville in 56, March, from Thursday to
Sunday.
And uh, in those days, most clubs had two groups.
So the main group from ...
both in a seven nights term, plus a matinee.
So, but shorter hours than in New York:
New York, those days, was 10 to 4, and Boston was 9 to 1, and seven nights, plus the
matinee Sunday afternoon.
So, um, I started to play, but the main group was from
Tuesday to Sunday.
And uh, that was very good for me, because I could hear also ... um,
the school thought--I think George Wein, actually, thought--that I should have a horn
player, so there was Boots Mussulli, who used to be an old timer with Stan Kentons
band.

870
Brown:
871
 Whats his name again?


872
Akiyoshi:
873
 Boots Mussulli.

874
Brown:
875
 Mussulli.

876
Akiyoshi:
877
 Boo--Boots Mussulli.
He was retired and he was from Milford,
Massachusetts.
And he was ...
I heard with a small group, recording, you know.
He had
impeccable technique, but for an Italian, he was very cold, kind of a very intellectual
player.
It was kind of like totally opposite of somebody like Charlie Mariano, who was
much more hot-blooded a player.
Boots was much more, kind of, intellectual, cool
player, and it was very good for me that he was there.
I used to ... you know, I used to,
when I played, I thought I did something wrong--in my mind--made a mistake, I used to
put my tongue out, you know, like, "Aww!
" like that (laughs), so Boots said, you know,
Don't do that.
Your mistakes are good: youre trying to build something from what you
thought you made (was) a mistake.
" He was very good for me, advice and so on.
It was
good.

878
Brown:
879
 And so the Storyville, was that something that was arranged through Berklee?
Did they arrange...?

880
Akiyoshi:
881
 Yes, yes, so....

882
Brown:
883
 And then you also said that you went to New York to play at the Hickory House.
How did...?

884
Akiyoshi:
885
 That was 57.

886
Brown:
887
 Okay, so this was later.

888
Akiyoshi:
889
 So, well, I mean, that ... the school asked the booking agent in New York
called Joe Glaser--the biggest one (client) was, I think, Armstrong.
Anyway, Joe
Glasers office handled my affairs and theyre the ones (who) booked my trio at Hickory
House.
I said this yesterday, but I really wanted to go to a place like Birdland, you know.

890
Brown:
891
 Right.

892
Akiyoshi:
893
 But the school thought it was a better place, it was supposed to be a higher
profile for a pianist.
But, I had a lot of problems at the Hickory House; it was six weeks,
two years in a row, 57 and 58.
But they were always, "Play show tunes!
Play show
tunes!
" Because most of ... thats a steak house, if you remember.
And um, the stage
was in the middle part; there was a circle bar, and the stage was on the inside of the bar,
so the people look at (you) like.... And usually, most of the people came to eat, have
some dinner before a Broadway show or whatever.
After Broadway show theyd come


back, either they would have dinner or a drink or whatever it is.
Thats what, I guess, the
theme was.
Most of those places you had to play a lot of show tunes, and I didnt know
too many show tunes, and wed play Buds tunes or Monks tunes, things like that, you
know, they always really ... "Play show tunes!
Play show tunes!
" And I ...
I, up til
today I think I was booked in the wrong place.
But ...
I dont blame them.
I think
theres a place--I didnt know then, I do now--but theres a place for that kind of ...
somewhere between a cocktail lounge and a jazz club, uh, different from a Five Spot or a
Half Note or a Birdland, and that goes in a different category.
I know now, but I didnt
know then, so I was playing things that they probably didnt want to hear (laughs).

894
Brown:
895
 (Laughs) Did you ever get to play Birdland during this period?

896
Akiyoshi:
897
 Oh, after I got out of school...,

898
Brown:
899
 Ah, okay.

900
Akiyoshi:
901
 ...and I think I mentioned yesterday, the fact is I was very lucky, that was
Oscar Woodstein, who was my manager at that time.
He hired me quite often.
So that
was really ... and, you know, I was saying before there were always two groups, and uh,
even though I was there.... See, New York was a six-night town, and no matinee, but
long hours.
But, always the main group was there--I wasnt, I didnt feel that
responsibility for drawing people.
But he always, often hired me.
Im grateful today.

902
Brown:
903
 Do you remember some of the groups that you were on the bill with?
The other
groups?

904
Akiyoshi:
905
 Oh yes.
Sometimes it was Miles group--only it was, John Coltrane was there
after Sonny Rollins.
That ... the old Birdlands band room, backstage, it was like what
we call ... Japanese have a saying, "a bed for an eel.
" In other words, long and narrow.
And thats where the backstage was.
But when it was Miles group, they all played very
long solos, except Miles didnt play long solos.
But ... hed (Coltrane) play a long solo,
then it was ... Coltrane would get off the stage and go backstage and try and woodshed.
And so you couldnt really use the room (laughs)!
That was a funny way ... and also,
Birdland was a very interesting place: that was the only place then, backstage there was a
little bar for musicians.
Set up for musicians.
And those days I wasnt drinking, so I
dont know how much it cost; I think it was maybe half-price or whatever it was.
And
uh, and those days it was the only club that took intermission ... excuse me, charged
admission, was Birdland.
That was the only place.
Every place, uh, some places mayve
had cover charges on the weekends, but they didnt have anything (on weekdays).
But
Birdland, you go step down, dun-dun-dun, then there was a little window just like a
movie theater.
I think it was $1.30, Im not quite sure, though.
Somewhere around there.
Then you go in there, there were three different sections.
Youre looking at the stage and


on the extreme right is the bar.
Thats where you ...
I think a drink was somewhere like
cents, it wasnt quite a dollar, I think, you know.
Then the next section was just chairs
only, where you didnt have to drink, you just--everybody had to pay admission--but if
you sit there, you could sit all night, not spending any more money.
Then, the third one,
which was the main part, where they had the tables.
They had a cover charge--I believe
it was $5, Im not quite sure.
I think it was $5--and thats where people could sit at a
table, but then you had to pay a cover charge.
But it was the three ... it was very good,
the fact is, if somebody was really into a certain group and they wanted to hear without
paying too much, there was a place where you could just sit, you didnt have to order any
drinks.
So that was a kind of unique place, I think, you know, for a long, long time.

906
Brown:
907
 How was the piano at Birdland?

908
Akiyoshi:
909
 The Birdland piano was not that great.
It was never gre ...
I dont think they
pianos) were their own, I think customarily they used to rent the piano from a piano
place, and periodically theyd change.
I remember much later, I was hired at Top of the
Gate as a soloist, in between other groups.
And uh, it wasnt a Steinway, but one time
they had a Steinway that was a ... this piano really liked me!
And we got along really
well, and if Id had the money I wouldve bought it.
But, it seems to be customary, they
kind of change, except the Half Note always had the same piano, I think.
But the places,
the Top of the Gate, they usually changed the piano.
Probably same thing at Birdland,
Im not quite sure.
But they had, at least they had a grand piano.
If you went outside
New York), like Philadelphia, I usually played--first time was the Blue Note, then after
that it was a place called Showboat--but they were all upright.
They didnt have grand
pianos.
And most of the keys were ... most of the places, it was upright piano.
Some
places ... there was a place called, uh ...
I think it was called the Dew Drop Inn, Im not
quite sure, I think it was called Dew Drop Inn, in New Jersey.
It was basically an organ
room.
But Sunday afternoons they had a jam (session), jazz.
And I was hired several
times but they always had a guest player--one time it was Jimmy Heath, another time it
was, I think, Diz--but this piano, a few strings were missing (laughs).
Things like that.
I
guess, some things have progressed today: at least you dont have pianos like that today!
(laughs)

910
Brown:
911
 (Laughs) You talked about a double bill with Miles Davis.
What was your
impression of John Coltrane?
Did you ... get to know him ... very well?

912
Akiyoshi:
913
 (Coughs) Well, the first time I heard of Coltrane was in Los Angeles.
And uh,
with Miles group with ... that was the first time I heard, uh....

914
Brown:
915
 Paul Chambers?

916
Akiyoshi:
917
 Paul Chambers.
And I think hed just joined, 56 January, because Id heard


probably heard every record when I was in Japan, and most of the players I knew.
But
Id never heard of Paul Chambers.
And uh ... boy, I caught the last set and he played,
took a solo, and I was "Boy!
" He sounded so good, I said "Ahh," and I didnt even know
the person, I thought, "My God!
What a country!
" you know.
People who had no names
played that great!
That wasnt the case, I found later on, but something like that.
And
Coltrane ...
I think I mayve said this before, he sounded more like, a little close to
Sonny Stitt, then um.... One short period, Miles had Sonny Rollins, and after Sonny
Rollins he came back, John Coltrane came back.
After that, it was a different Coltrane.
He was woodshedding almost all the time, he was just practicing all the time.
And thats
what everybody knows, you know, Coltrane today, I think.

918
Brown:
919
 So, uh, going back to the trajectory of your career: so, youre starting to get a
name, youre playing the major clubs.
Are you starting to tour at this point?
Oh, maybe I
misrepresented this.... (laughs)

920
Akiyoshi:
921
 No, actually, you know, after I got out of school and I moved to New York,
my very, original intention was, after I finished school, I should go back to Japan and I
was supposed to, uh, I thought I should, uh ... give to fellow musicians, you know, to
pass on something that I have learned.
But when I finished school, I didnt realize, and it
was just, "Boy, what did I do?
What did I accomplish?
What did I learn?
" I realized
that I hadnt learned anything.
I said, "Well, gee, I dont think I can go home now," so I
moved to New York.
And after I moved to New York, I was just like everybody else,
you know, just barely paying the rent.
Its kind of interesting, because Im basically kind
of shy--I think it comes up from my upbringing--so I had somebody come in from the
other side, and I knew who they are, who he is, or most of the men, the players.
Id say,
Oh, I dont think he knows me, and if he says hi, I think I might say hi.
" You know,
something like that, never....
So when I moved to New York, I decided that I was going
to push myself to say "hello," you know.
So theres Birdland ... and when I moved I was
staying in a hotel called Hotel Bryant.

922
Brown:
923
 Bryant.
Where was...?

924
Akiyoshi:
925
 It was 54th and off Broadway.
And uh, there was a ... 52nd and Broadway, as
you know, was Birdland.
But, it wasnt the corner, there was Birdland.
There on the
corner was a coffee shop and one day I went there to have some breakfast--in my case, a
late breakfast--and I saw Slide Hampton sitting in there.
My first reaction was, "Oh, Im
going to go home," but then I decided, "I think Ill go up," and I said, "Hello.
" He said,
Oh yes, please sit down.
" Then he said--this was kind of interesting--he said, "You
know, I used to think you were stuck up!
But I know you are shy.
" So I realized that
people do think that way, and I had to go up and say "hello.
" And also at the same time,
in later years, even today, some people, I think ... you know, like a little ... they think
they take themselves seriously.
And uh, then think about what Slide said, and say,


Maybe theyre shy," so I give them the benefit of the doubt.
So that was good that he
said that.

926
Brown:
927
 Youre starting to become a New Yorker now (chuckles).

928
Akiyoshi:
929
 Mm, I dont know; I was just like any other New York jazz musician who
didnt have much name and was struggling.
You know, I was, I became a part of it.

930
Brown:
931
 So, um, so this is into the late fifties now.
So in 1959, kind of a lot of changes
happen in your life.

932
Akiyoshi:
933
 Uh, it did?

934
Brown:
935
 Uh, well, you married Charlie Mariano.

936
Akiyoshi:
937
 Oh yes.

938
Brown:
939
 (Chuckles)

940
Akiyoshi:
941
 Yes and uh, right.
And that ... we moved to New Jersey.
And we formed a
quartet.
Before that, I was always with a trio, so we had a quartet.
But it was the same
time.... And, my job was not only that I had to call Joe Glasers office every once in a
while, to say, "Do you have anything for us?
" Cause as it was, theyd forget, so it was
something periodically, I had to do to do that.
That was ...
I wasnt quite comfortable
with that, but it was, that was necessary.
And sometimes theyd say, "Oh yes, we have
some place in Pittsburgh," or things like that.
But its amazing, actually, (that we)
survived.
Always, something came up, so that we could pay the rent.

942
Brown:
943
 How did you meet Charlie?

944
Akiyoshi:
945
 School.
He was ... when I was still in school, he was in Shellys group, Shelly
Mannes group in Los Angeles.
But he was originally from Boston.
And uh, he decided
to come home.
So when he came back to Boston, he started teaching school.
Thats how
I met him, you know.

946
Brown:
947
 And it ... you had a quintet as well as a quartet with Charlie?

948
Akiyoshi:
949
 No, quartet.

950
Brown:
951
 Just only a quartet?

952
Akiyoshi:
953
 Just a quartet.


954
Brown:
955
 Okay, so that needs to be corrected ... the Grove lists a quintet, as well.
And
you had personnel, was Gene and Jake first, or no?

956
Akiyoshi:
957
 No, the time when we had a quartet together, Jake was already, hed left
school--I think he was playing with Woodys band--it could be, I think it was Woody
Hermans band.
It could be Maynards (Ferguson), Im not quite sure about that part.
But, so, Gene Cherico, always he had a knack for finding a drummer.
We had a job in
Hartford, a place called High Brein (sp??
) Lounge--or Few Brein (sp??
), I dont know
how to pronounce it--it was a beer company or whatever.
Anyway, we were looking for
a drummer, Gene said, "Oh, theres a drummer, Eddie Marshall," you know, "he is really
good!
" And he was about twenty-, maybe, two years old or something.
"We should try
him!
" So we went to High Brein Lounge and he came--hes from Springfield,
Massachusetts--so he came and sat in and played.
I really liked it, of course, and Gene
.. usually bass players and drummers, if theyre getting on well, thats a good rhythm
section so.... And Eddie was so nervous (chuckles), he spilled water onto Marianos lap.
He still is a very good friend of mine and also I, you know, often play with him, and uh
.. theres something about when youre young, when you play together for a while, its
always something special.
So after that, it was Eddie and Gene, thats the group we went
to our first Japanese trip, to Japan, the concert trip to Japan was 61.
That was the first
one, after five years in this country, it was the first time I was back in Japan.
And it was
Eddie and Gene.
And it was the same thing the second time, I think.
So, he, then he was
drafted, Eddie was drafted into the Army, and for a while he was away.
And he came
back and we ... at that time, and then we played together, we played (as) a trio quite
often.
And of course, Gene went to Frank Sinatra....

958
Brown:
959
 (Laughs)

960
Akiyoshi:
961
 (Laughs) And Eddie and Gene both were at one time with Stan Getz, and one
day I got a call from them, somewhere, and they said, "Toshiko, you got your rhythm
section back.
"

962
Brown:
963
 (Laughs)

964
Akiyoshi:
965
 They decided to quit (laughs).

966
Brown:
967
 Well, I know Eddie, of course, being in San Francisco.
Hes a great friend and
also hes a great, great inspiration of mine.
I have my idea of what makes Eddie great;
what would you say were the hallmarks, or what was it about his style that you like?

968
Akiyoshi:
969
 Well, first of all, I think its that he has a good beat, which is very important to
me.
Sometimes its ... this is something that is ... its not mathematically.... And also,


not every drummer is for every somebody.
In other words, if a drummers great for
somebody else, it doesnt mean great for me.
Theres a certain mystical, certain things
there, and it was something you can identify, you know, together.
Eddies great part was
that hes also very open minded: hes a very intelligent man, and uh, he also, hes the first
drummer that I know--I met, that is--who played soft with the sticks.
He really had a
beautiful touch, and he was, as I said, he was very open minded, he was very susceptible
to many different things.
He still is.

970
Brown:
971
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

972
Akiyoshi:
973
 So we are very good friends, I would like to say.
You know, he said, the other
day, he was saying--I dont know how he said it--he said, "Tooo-shiko, I am getting
old" (chuckles).

974
Brown:
975
 (Laughs)

976
Akiyoshi:
977
 I dont know why he said that!

978
Brown:
979
 (Laughs) What was your impression going back to Japan, after having not been
back in four years?

980
Akiyoshi:
981
 I was very, very worried about it, because five years I was away, and I didnt
know if people would remember me or not.
And also this time, we were going back with
our original music, most of my original music, which was not done in those days in
Japan.
People always played, you know, somebody elses music or standards, things like
that.
So I had to explain about the music: explain to the point where it was easy to
understand and, you know, some kind of guide for listening.
That was ... but when we
landed at Haneda--those days, Haneda airport--and the plane was about four hours late.
But there were people waiting and I was really surprised.
You know, there was, like,
cameras and journalists were there, and a lot of fans were waiting, and I was really
surprised about that.
So, in those days, the tour was a very long dis--, that time it was
six weeks long.
And in 1963, we went back again, with the same promoter, also six
weeks.
But now, if you have a tour, so usually they say, I dont know, if you have
fourteen concerts, thats pretty, pretty long.

982
Brown:
983
 So six weeks, you mustve toured....

984
Akiyoshi:
985
 Yes.

986
Brown:
987
 ...outside of Tokyo as well?
What kind of...?

988
Akiyoshi:
989
 Every (kind of) places that you can think of, I think.


990
Brown:
991
 (Laughs) Okay.

992
Akiyoshi:
993
 And those days also, I think it was, um, union--uh, Ron (abbreviation for
Kinrsha Ongaku Kygikai, Workers Music Council) they called (it)--labor unions had
music activities.
And those were the ones that had, like, sort of like a network for going
to places, and I think that was the main, you know, outlet, yeah.

994
Brown:
995
 Because when you were talking about the scene in Japan, the jazz in scene in
Japan before you left, um, how that it was mostly centralized in (the) Tokyo area.
Now
were you able, did you go to ja-, was there a jazz scene in saka...?

996
Akiyoshi:
997
 Different places, right.

998
Brown:
999
 ...or Nara, or other places?
So you went all over Japan.

1000
Akiyoshi:
1001
 Right, yes.

1002
Brown:
1003
 So that time, by (the) sixties, there were many different clubs in different cities,
jazz clubs.

1004
Akiyoshi:
1005
 Yeah, not ... (they were) all concerts.

1006
Brown:
1007
 All concerts.

1008
Akiyoshi:
1009
 I dont think we ever played a club in those days, you know, they were all
concerts.
In sixty, 61, uh ... Art Blakey went in January--his group, (Jazz)
Messengers--and we went there in March.
So, but after that, Art Blakey, every year, he
would go to Japan, and that was the beginning of the American players going, (to) start
going to Japan.

1010
Brown:
1011
 Mm-hmm.

1012
Akiyoshi:
1013
 He was really popular in Japan.

1014
Brown:
1015
 Did you consider your tour successful?
Did your, the audience enjoy your
music?

1016
Akiyoshi:
1017
 Apparently it was successful, otherwise we would not have gone back in 63.
Excuse me.
(Goes to see about periodic beeping sound)

1018
Brown:
1019
 Is that a smoke alarm?


1020
Akiyoshi:
1021
 (Track starts in middle of sentence) ...same, six, uh, six weeks.
And that time
I stayed, because (in) 63 I was pregnant with my first child, and I was a little worried
about having a child in this country.
I wanted to be near my mother.
So after that I just
stayed, and I was due in August, so I just stayed there and had my child, which is ... now
she has her own family and own group.

1022
Brown:
1023
 Could you say her name?

1024
Akiyoshi:
1025
 Monday Michiru.

1026
Brown:
1027
 Say it again, please?

1028
Akiyoshi:
1029
 Monday, you know, like Tuesday, Monday, Tuesday...?

1030
Brown:
1031
 (Chuckles) Okay.

1032
Akiyoshi:
1033
 Thats because she was born on a Monday, so I named her Monday.
Michiru
is a Japanese ... Michiru is like uh, you know, tide it comes, high tide?
Thats ... its like
.. we call it michiru.
Michiru means something thats little and it gets fuller, so I was
hoping that she would get mature as a human being as she got older, so on, you know,
thats what....

1034
Brown:
1035
 And what was her birth date?

1036
Akiyoshi:
1037
 August 19th.

1038
Brown:
1039
 August 19th, 1963?

1040
Akiyoshi:
1041
 Yes.

1042
Brown:
1043
 Uh-huh, okay.

1044
Akiyoshi:
1045
 Im not quite sure she appreciates that (laughs)..., saying that, though!

1046
Brown:
1047
 Well, her mother gave her her birthday, so she can give her birthday, too.

1048
Akiyoshi:
1049
 No, but she is a singer and a writer, and its different than, you know I always
say its different from a musician, because they ... also, they have a different union, you
know (laughs).

1050
Brown:
1051
 Different union?
(laughs)



1052
Akiyoshi:
1053
 That proves (it)!

1054
Brown:
1055
 Its all economics.
So, um, lets go back: so in 62 you went to Japan, in 63 you
went to Japan, but in 62 also, something significant happened in your life.

1056
Akiyoshi:
1057
 Sixty-what?

1058
Brown:
1059
 62?
1962?

1060
Akiyoshi:
1061
 Two?

1062
Brown:
1063
 So you went to Japan in 61-62...?

1064
Akiyoshi:
1065
 61 and 63.

1066
Brown:
1067
 63?
So, 62 something ... this is when you played with Charles Mingus?

1068
Akiyoshi:
1069
 No, no.

1070
Brown:
1071
 No?

1072
Akiyoshi:
1073
 Playing with Charles Mingus was after I was separated from, uh....

1074
Brown:
1075
 Charlie?

1076
Akiyoshi:
1077
 ...Mariano.
So, its much later.
I, I....
It has to be after 64....

1078
Brown:
1079
 Has to be after 64?

1080
Akiyoshi:
1081
 ...because in 64 Japan had the Olympics....

1082
Brown:
1083
 Right.
I was there, too (chuckles).

1084
Akiyoshi:
1085
 So, no, I was there, uh....

1086
Brown:
1087
 Duke Ellington came, too.

1088
Akiyoshi:
1089
 Oh, yes, yes.

1090
Brown:
1091
 Yeah, I remember.


1092
Akiyoshi:
1093
 So it has to be after that.

1094
Brown:
1095
 Mm-hmm.

1096
Akiyoshi:
1097
 So the Mingus....
When Mingus asked me to join, I was really alone and
struggling.
Barely paying the rent.
And uh, my daughter was with my sister in Japan,
and--I think shed just started kindergarten or something, kindergarten or grammar
school, Im not quite sure.

1098
Brown:
1099
 So she was born in 63, so lets go back....

1100
Akiyoshi:
1101
 Yes.

1102
Brown:
1103
 So, for the record, make sure that, in Grove Dictionary they have it listed as 62,
that is incorrect.

1104
Akiyoshi:
1105
 Okay, now, she was born in 63, so it has to be, with Mingus, it has to be after

Thats what I think.

1106
Brown:
1107
 Okay, okay.
So ... so lets go back.
In 63, you give birth to your daughter, so
you stay in Japan?

1108
Akiyoshi:
1109
 Yes.

1110
Brown:
1111
 For how long?

1112
Akiyoshi:
1113
 From there, in 64, uh, Mariano and I went to Europe for ... we had a club
engagement in Paris for four weeks, and then two weeks in each, one in Copenhagen, and
another one in Sweden, at the Golden Circle, I think it was.
In Denmark was, you know,
more (of a) market.
Then we went back to Japan again, so that ... uh, 63, and 64, thats
when the Olympics.... And I had a little project.
We had a concert, the project with....
And we were trying to get, saying this is.... Um, you know, people have....
In those
days, I thought--I still feel the same way, but--people have very poor ears.
In other
words, since printing was invented, eyesight, everything, all the information goes from
the eyes, but--I dont if thats the reason or not--but the ear has never developed.
So,
people have a difficult time understanding music, and I thought maybe I could do
something with movement.
So not dance--but it is dance--but you dont see the dancer.
It was a shadow.
So I had this project and I had a concert and it was, the screen was
behind us, and the dancer would dance behind the screen.
So thats what comes out as a
shadow, the movement.
And it would help ...
I thought that might help music for the
listener, and help them to kind of maybe understand the music.
They dont have to
understand, but appreciate, the music.
Thats what I thought, and this was something I


have done one time only.
But I think that was a pretty good idea.
But anyway, so I had
this Japanese traditional dance company, but "traditional" meaning not real traditional,
but kind of modern pro-.... Its very strange, but its not a ballet, its not a modern ballet,
but it is modern traditional dancing.
Thats kind of a funny way to say it, but there was a
dance group--it was kind of a noted group--so I asked her to participate and she was
very happy to do that.
So that was done while we had, Japan had the Olympics.
So after
that, um ..., Mariano realized that he couldnt really ... have enough activity in Japan, so
he wanted to come back to the States.
So we came back to the States at the end of 64.
It
could be 65.
I think end of 64, whatever it was.
So all that time from ... so I would say
a year in Japan.
My daughter was born in August, then it was the following year.
The
following year, I think maybe it was close to winter, possibly, because.... Now I think it
was close to winter--probably the end of 64--because I remember I knit her clothes in
yarn, so I think it was winter.

1114
Brown:
1115
 And when you came back to New York...?

1116
Akiyoshi:
1117
 We settled in, uh, New Jersey.
And shortly after that, uh, Mariano and I were
separated for private reasons.
And uh, that ... then it was very difficult, a difficult life for
me started, because if youre a jazz player, you have to travel.
You cant stay in one
place.
And I couldnt travel because my daughter was three-and-a-half, three years,
three-and-a-half years old.
Lemme see: no, one ... one-and-a-half, yeah, one-and-a-half
years old.
So ... and I didnt have enough money to have a housekeeper, because....
Jazz players, its hard to get a babysitter, because New York--as I said before--you
worked from 10 to 4 in the morning.
And there is no babysitter who will come for that
particular hour.
So you really needed a live-in and I just didnt have that kind of, you
know, funds.
I didnt have the money.
So, til today I think the most important things,
you cant solve by money; but money can solve a lot of problems (chuckles).

1118
Brown:
1119
 (Chuckles)

1120
Akiyoshi:
1121
 So unfortunately, that was ... so I think my daughter had a very, very difficult
childhood.
And then finally I decided, my immediate sister didnt have any children, and
she wanted to know if I would send her to ... send my daughter to her so she would....
And I then thought about it, and then I decided maybe I would send her.
Maybe
meanwhile, maybe I might be able to come to the point where I could get more jobs or
something.
But uh ... so she was in Japan til, uh ... first grade, beginning of first grade,
I think it was.
The beginning of her first grade, she was there.
Seven years old, it
probably was.
Yeah, three to seven years old.
But unfortunately I didnt ...
I didnt, uh
.. become like a household name.
Somehow, I mean, there were always some jobs, you
know.
I ...
I, meanwhile I had to like ... uh, I was hired to do some festival, and ... for
example, in the afternoon I was put into a trio with Elvin Jones, and then it was, uh,
Miroslav (Vitous) had just come from, uh....



1122
Brown:
1123
 Czechoslovakia.

1124
Akiyoshi:
1125
 Yeah, Czechoslovakia, hed just come and there was this ...
I dont know how
that happened, but I was hired to do things like that.
But, you know, one job, it doesnt
really support...(laughs).
But somehow I always had a little job and (its) amazing to me
when I think about it: the fact is that somehow I paid the rent.
But it never came (to)
more than that.
And even though (chuckles)--this is, I think Im kind of, sort of like a
really simple-minded person--because it never occurred to me that I could go to Berklee
and teach.
It never even occurred to me.
And thats, a lot of people did, you know, go to
teach.
And a lot of musicians teach over here at schools, too.
But um ... (chuckles) so I
think Im pretty simple-minded, the fact that I, and its amazing, the fact that it never
even occurred to me (laughs).

1126
Brown:
1127
 Maybe it wasnt something you were interested in.

1128
Akiyoshi:
1129
 Probably not.
And sometimes Japanese journalists, jazz journalists, said,
You could come back to Japan, and youd be a star!
" And that didnt even occur to me,
either, you know!

1130
Brown:
1131
 So I guess it was during this time then that you did play with Charles Mingus.
Is
that correct?

1132
Akiyoshi:
1133
 Yes.
I was just playing solo at the ... the solo started as a ... actually, I was
going to have a day job, because, you know, children dont grow younger, they get older,
and need, uh ... need the funds to raise them.
And my prospects as a jazz player werent
that great, so I thought, "Well, I probably need a day job.
" So I paid $100 to init-- for a
computer programming school.
It was four months at a time, and I was in the middle of
it, so I had to wait for the time when they started a new one (term).
And, meanwhile, I
went to the Jazz Gallery, the Five Spot, you know, its in ... and there were Joe and Iggy
Termini, who were the owners, brothers.
And Joe came up to me and said, "Do you feel
like playing solo?
" And he said, "I just cant afford to have two bands anymore, two
groups anymore, and if you play solo maybe you can play intermission here.
" Thats
how I was saved and I didnt go to computer school.

1134
Brown:
1135
 (Chuckles) Thank goodness!

1136
Akiyoshi:
1137
 (Chuckling) I think about it, I say, probably the Buddha said, "Dont go, Ill
get you some job.
" So this job, it was a long time.
Then when finally the Five Spot
closed, Art DLugoff of the Gate, Top of the Gate, you know, Village Gate, and Top of
the Gate was used most of the time was (for) trio jobs.
And so Art said, "Come play at
my place," so I was playing solo there, also.
In those times, John Lewis used to come in


and I didnt even know John was there, you know, but he used to come in to, I dont
know, listen to ... well, he used to come in, but anyway....
So, when I was doing that,
Mingus came to me and said, "Why dont you join my group?
" And uh ... before that, I
must mention about John Lewis, though, because this probably ... Im not quite sure, Im
kind of a little bit mixed up as far as that is concerned.
Mingus asked me ... could be,
that could be first.... Um, "Why dont you join my group?
" And I said, "Why?
There
are so many good players," and he said, "Its true that there are a lot of good players, but
youre a new name," he said, "Youre a new name, and a new name is very important to
the group.
" Now, that really impressed me, because Mingus, he couldve said to me,
Its good for you, youll get recognition," which I did.
Uh, "many people will notice
you," and like this.
He couldve said that to me, but he didn't.
You know, he was ...
many people, I think, disregard that part of Mingus, you know.
They always ... its more
fun to talk about the other part of Mingus (laughs), so probably thats what they always
talk about.
But he was like that.
So I joined the group and then was ... that was kind of
an interesting experience, the fact is, because ... for several reasons.
One--I think I
mentioned yesterday--he rehearsed, the rehearsal was at his apartment.
And uh, he
didnt have any music: he sang and we all had to learn that.
I think thats the best way.
But it was a small group, and so on.
And, when I joined, immediately we had (a gig at)
Peps in Philadelphia.
Peps was around the corner from the Showboat where I used to
play with a trio, but Peps was a bigger club, you know.
And ...
I think Pepper Adams
was playing; and uh, there was a trombone player--Im trying to think--it could be
Garnett, I dont quite remember.
It could be Garnett Brown, I dont know.
But one point
.. when I first had joined, there was Booker Ervin.
I used to call him "Long John
Silver," because he looked like Robert Newton (laughs).
So ... and Rich Williams was
on trumpet.
So when we went there ... so we were there two weeks.
Two weeks ... the
front line changed, you know.
So the second week, Mingus would say, "The next
weekend, Basies band comes, and we gotta, so we really have to rehearse.
" So we were
rehearsing many tunes, and so they came for a couple days, the weekend that Basies
band was there, and we ... he never played the ones we rehearsed (laughs).

1138
Brown:
1139
 (Laughs)

1140
Akiyoshi:
1141
 It was really, kind of like that.
And uh ... then at some point, we were at the
Newport festival, but not in Newport, it was Cliff Manor, I think it was called.
Cliff, uh
.. it was more like a protest....

1142
Brown:
1143
 The alternate festival.

1144
Akiyoshi:
1145
 Yes, it was a little ... out at that place.
I think it was something like that.
And
uh ... we also, there was twice--I have a picture--so we played at Newport up front, on
the main stage, but maybe another year, probably, we played the protest place.
But the
one that I have (chuckles), the one photo was I was playing the bass.
And he had a tune


called "Eat That Chicken," and its in A-flat.
And (sings), "eat that chicken, eat that
chicken, eat that chicken now," and he always played piano on that one.
He wanted me
to play the bass.
So (laughs), we were doing that and somebody took a photo and it was
at Newport.
So I remember that.
We did one year, one year we were playing the main
Newport, another year it was the other place, and I dont quite remember when was
when.
Somebody was writing a Mingus book, and he kind of reminded me I was there
two different times with Mingus.
So I guess hes probably accurate, I dont quite
remem--.
But at one point it was a quintet--this one for quite a long time was a
quintet--Larry, uh, Lonnie, I think, Hillyer....

1146
Brown:
1147
 Oh, Hillyer, yeah.

1148
Akiyoshi:
1149
 ...uh, the ... uh, McPherson.

1150
Brown:
1151
 Oh, Charles McPherson.

1152
Akiyoshi:
1153
 Yes.
He was such a sweet man!
Hes the one and uh ... Charlie McPherson.
So those two were the quintet.
And this one (Mingus) kept quite a long time as a quintet.

1154
Brown:
1155
 And of course, Dannie Richmond on drums?

1156
Akiyoshi:
1157
 Hmm?

1158
Brown:
1159
 Dannie Richmond on drums?

1160
Akiyoshi:
1161
 Dannie Richmond was, but ... see, those days, when you had a drug (arrest)
record, you couldnt play Philadelphia.
So Dannie couldnt play Philadelphia, he would
have somebody else, and ...
I dont quite remember who he had, but.... Mingus and
Dannie Richmond were more like they were a couple: theyd go so well together, they
could change the rhythm pattern and so on together, and so.... And Dannie was a very
nice man.
He was a really nice man, and Lew had some trips (with him) in Canada, a
couple times, together.
But he loved duck, and I cooked the duck here sometimes.
He a
really nice man, though, but that was Dannie Richmond.
I just uh ...
I couldnt stop
missing my music, so I quit.

1162
Brown:
1163
 So what year was that?
What, what time period?

1164
Akiyoshi:
1165
 Im trying to think what year it was, because after I quit a white lady was the
pianist, but then Mingus called me and wanted me to come back.
And maybe it was
because, he said, "I have a concert," you know, "I have a recording," I mean, "I have a
recording.
" And uh ... "So I want you to come back.
" And this was ... the first intention
was to record at the Five Spot, then it got ... it was a tuba player--I forgot his name, he


usually played at the Radio City Orchestra.
Um, I dont think he was a jazz player.
But
anyway, a tuba player.
Then, you know, the next thing, it gets bigger, bigger, bigger, and
the next thing you know its a Town Hall concert.
And you have everything: two drums,
two guitars, two pianos (chuckles).
Snooky Young was the lead trumpet player, and we
were rehearsing from 12 oclock.
And the music was not ready (chuckles)!
And it was
already four in the morning, back to the elevator going up, Snooky looked so insecure,
What is going to happen!
" you know (laughs).
That was the famous, famous....

1166
Brown:
1167
 Album ().

1168
Akiyoshi:
1169
 Concert.

1170
Brown:
1171
 Sure.
So for the larger ensemble, how did Mingus, did he still recite all the parts
to everybody?
Or did he write any charts...?

1172
Akiyoshi:
1173
 No, he never did.

1174
Brown:
1175
 Never did.

1176
Akiyoshi:
1177
 But the Town Hall concert, yes.
Town Hall concert (October 12, 1962), it was
at the rehearsal, there was an arranger.
And I remember one arranger was (Gene Roland)
.. he used to play what they call "peck horn" (alto horn), and he wrote like it was
arranged for ... the Kenton band or something.
Anyway, he arranged, he did not write.
He said, "Thats not what I told him to ... orchestrate," he said, "Cost me $500 and he
doesnt come up (with it)," blah, blah, blah, and there were things like that.
But uh, it
was a really ... no music was prepared.
So when we were at the Town Hall (and it)
opened, there were copyists there--I dont know if youve heard from other people--
there were copyists in the middle of the stage.
And Mingus said, "Well, this is a
recording session.
If anybody has heard its a concert, you should get your money back.
"
So everybody was trying to get their money back, and then the mob police had to come
out (chuckles), in the street.
And it was ... but Mingus strongest point was he would, at
that particular spot, even if it was a concert, he would sing what to do.
You know, like
say, "Whap!
" so on, so on.
Hes playing and he said, "Whap!
" and he sang and that is
what the trumpet player had to do, and so on.
He came up at an instant, uh, phrase, he
would come up with something for the musicians to play.
And that was, he was at (his)
best.
It was really, you know, he was really a special ...
I think really special ...
probably you could call (him) a genius.
He was like, (in) an instant he could come up
with....
He could make music very exciting.
So ... thats something like a ...
I always
felt like his music reminded me of Mexican painting, you know: very colorful, very
strong.

1178
Brown:
1179
 Do you feel like you were influenced by...?


1180
Akiyoshi:
1181
 Oh, definitely.
I think I was influenced by him quite a lot.

1182
Brown:
1183
 And did you have a good personal relationship with him?

1184
Akiyoshi:
1185
 I like to think so, yes, yes.
Somebody tried to say, somebody said that
Mingus, uh ... put the lid of the piano over my hand.
He never did that.
If he did that I
probably wouldnt have a hand (laughs).
You know, people come up with all kinds of
stupid lies.
He wasnt ... but he was very nasty to other players.
You know, sometimes
if he didnt like (something or someone), hed kick the drums and things like that
laughs).
So, he had two different personalities.

1186
Brown:
1187
 Maybe nowadays they would say he was bipolar.
But who knows?
I dont
know, but we know that he died from Lou Gehrigs disease.

1188
Akiyoshi:
1189
 Oh, really?
I didnt know that.

1190
Brown:
1191
 Charles Mingus?

1192
Akiyoshi:
1193
 Huh?

1194
Brown:
1195
 He died from Lou Gehrigs disease?

1196
Akiyoshi:
1197
 Oh, Lou Gehrigs disease?
I didnt know.
You know, he used to have like a
big bump in the arm....

1198
Brown:
1199
 Oh.

1200
Akiyoshi:
1201
 ... and he was in the hospital--uh, Mount Sinai--and I went to see him.
And
he was so big.
He was walking from there, so big that he looked almost feminine.
And
uh, uh ... it was some kind of lump, real big lump, and um....

1202
Brown:
1203
 On both arms?

1204
Akiyoshi:
1205
 No, on one arm.

1206
Brown:
1207
 One arm.

1208
Akiyoshi:
1209
 One arm.
I didnt know what it was....
When I had my very first Town Hall
concert)--first and only--that is, 67.
1956, when I came to this country--I think I
mentioned that--in 1966 I was, as I said, I was barely paying the rent, and 66, uh, New
Years ... the Japanese always think of New Years Day, you get introspective, you


know.
"What did I do?
Ive been in this country for ten years.
What did I do?
I didnt
do anything.
Maybe I will have a concert," you know, "maybe Ill have a concert;
maybe people might notice if I have a concert.
" So it took me a year to prepare,
basically, the funds.
And at that time someone asked me if I would do ... uh, the Holiday
Inn circuit, it was hotel lounges.
And uh ... so I ...
I went to this--I had to do an
audition--to this apartment and an old man was there and there was a piano.
And I
played and he said, "Oh, youre a jazz player!
" And I said, "I dont sing," so--those
places, of course, you sing--but I dont sing, so I dont know.
But he said, "Oh, its fine,
fine.
But you just have to play a lot of arpeggios!
" (laughs) Said, "You have to play that
arpeggio!
" So anyway, I got the job.
It was ... the greatest thing about the job, I was
getting $200 a week, but no overhead: hotel and food were paid (for).
And I didnt have
my apartment, I was still staying at a hotel here, so I didnt have that either.
So there was
no overhead.
And it was ... very soon I had about $3000 and I was.... Those days, a
house, you could buy a house for $15,000.
And it was six months later, I was thinking,
Gee, if I gig for another six months, I may be able to buy a house.
" But I didnt do that,
anyway (laughs).

1210
Brown:
1211
 (Laughs)

1212
Akiyoshi:
1213
 I needed about $3000 those days to--isnt that something?
So cheap, you
cant think of it today--the Town Hall concert.
And that was a self-produced concert.
Then it took me a year to prepare.
And ... then, uh, that time the mayor was (John)
Lindsay, that was the mayor.
And for some reason, he named that particular day
October 7, 1967) as the "Jazz Day" of New York.
Now, that's my luck!
My God!
You
know, as I said, I prepared from a year before.
And about a couple months before,
whatever it is, and he said it its "Jazz (Day).
" So they had like a black-tie, invitation-
only kind of jazz concert at the Metropolitan (Museum of Art).
Then there was a free
concert at Central Park, things like that.
And ... (gasps) ... all the jazz critics, of course,
came to my concert.
And also Mingus came to my concert, with a camera.
I thought that
was a really, you know, great gesture.
And thanks to John Wilson, he wrote a really
good review.
But ... it didnt do anything!
It didnt do any good.
After that, I was still
barely paying the rent!
(laughs)

1214
Brown:
1215
 Did you have good attendance, though?

1216
Akiyoshi:
1217
 I wont say that.
Maybe half?
Uh, because there was ...
I had to sell.... See,
this is interesting: I had a friend who used to with Martha Grahams dance company, a
Japanese woman, and she said, "Well, you know, you can do it.
Its a little hard, but if
you just go to a Japanese company and bow, then they will buy tickets," and so on.
In
those days, there were not that many companies.
But I would have to go from one
company to another, they would buy five tickets here, three tickets here.
That took like
.. most of the companies, they only had offices only.
Not like today, you know; today


its like poo!--I can sell 250 tickets in one company (chuckles).
But it was like this, so I
had to go from ... 9 in the morning to 5, usually about three companies I could cover in a
day.
Then, from 4 oclock I would write.
And from ... almost six in the morning, I
would write.
I had five music (charts) to write, for the big band, that is.
So, that was like
.. probably that was the hardest, and uh ... when I finished the concert, I was like whew,
like really, because I dont think I could do that today (chuckles).

1218
Brown:
1219
 (Laughs) (Phone rings, plays Beethovens Fifth Symphony) I guess its a good
time to take a break!
I guess you really do love Beethoven!
So Toshiko-san, also
significant about the Town Hall concert is you meet Lew Tabackin, yes?

1220
Akiyoshi:
1221
 (Inhales) Yes.
That, that was kind of funny in a sense, because I was looking
for a tenor player.
As I said before, I was preparing for the whole year.
Now ... uh,
Clark Terry had a big band in those days, and they used to play, uh ...
I think it was every
weekend, at the Half Note (which) used to be on Spring Street.
Half Note was Spring
Street.
There was a piano player, the pianist was Don Friedman.
But Don got some job
in Queens somewhere, it was some place where, kind of, long term or something.
So the
manager of Clarks band at that time, his name was Bob Messenger.
And he called me,
he said, "Well, Don cannot make it.
Can you sit in?
" So I was subbing, I said, "Well, it
may be interesting to read the music, but I havent read music for a long time.
" So, okay,
I went there.
And ... if you know the Half Note, the middle was the bar, a circular bar,
and the band was upstairs.
Now, the room was two, divided in two, one side and another
side.
Then when the big band went on the top, the rhythm section was on this side, the
horn players were kind of spread, so to speak.
So, I was there, and Clark started with a
D-flat blues or something like that.
So I had to play (mumbles), then Clark played
something, then it was, I heard a tenor player play, and it was, boy, that like knocked me
out!
It was an interesting combination: were talking about this, like 67, you know.
And
.. it had Lucky Thompsons family tree, which was very rare to hear in those days--I
guess it still is today.
But what he played was like a semi-cross between Coltrane and
Sonny Rollins....

1222
Brown:
1223
 (Laughs)

1224
Akiyoshi:
1225
 ...you know, a cross between that (mimics sound).
"Why that?
Who could
that be?
" (mimics sound again).
So, make the story short, that was Lew, and thats the
first time I met him, and then I said, "I want to cop him for my concert.
" And he sorta
agreed, but ... there was, Thad (Jones) and Mel (Lewis)s band had a swing tour in
California, and Lew was asked to go.
I think it was, that time I think it was somebody
else who couldnt go or something, because Lew wasnt really a member.
So of course,
naturally, three weeks against one job, he went there, so he didnt play my concert
laughs), he didnt play my concert.
But thats how I met him.
Then, uh, I would have
some, periodically I would have some jobs, for example, Hartford had a jazz society, and


they asked me to come and play, and with a horn player.
So that was the first time,
actually this was the first time we played together, quartet.
And ... so, Jake, he was, Jake
Hanna was living in New York at that time and he didnt have anything, so he said, "I
think Im gonna come listen to you.
" So he was coming with us, and Lew was with
somebody else--you had to take a ... you have to drive there, so on.
So as I said, I didnt
know him, Id just met him, so I was kind of a little cocky, and I said (chuckles), I said,
you know, "Ill play trio for a few numbers, then I will announce you and Ill bring (you)
over, so you play," you know (laughs).
So, okay, so I played, then I (said), "Lew
Tabackin," and he played tenor--he really, he played a long solo.
He still does, but he
really ... what he played, it knocked me out!
Then he started taking (out) the flute, and I
said to myself, "Oh my God," because most great saxophone players play terrible flute.
So I thought, "Oh my God, Im going to hear some terrible, sad flute" (laughs).

1226
Brown:
1227
 (Laughs)

1228
Akiyoshi:
1229
 They said it was "Willow Weep for Me," and it was like his ... as you know,
his flute, you know, hes got a beautiful sound....

1230
Brown:
1231
 Hes actually providing the soundtrack for your oral history right now!
(laughs)

1232
Akiyoshi:
1233
 (Laughs) Its a beautiful sound, and that was a real surprise for me, I said,
Wow!
" So thats how I met (Lew) and we played together.
Since then, if I have
something, you know, a quartet situation, I always asked him, because he was free-lance
and also he was, he had one leg in the studio.
And he was with, uh ... Clark Terrys
band.
And Clark Terrys band, this was the one--I think they went somewhere, either
North Carolina or Georgia, one of those places--and they met at midnight at a bar, uh,
something Street, its moved up, uh, what do you call, famous, I think....
The bus
there, everybody took that, and they drove all night to get to one concert and then came
back.
I think there was very little money.
And uh ... those were the days.
You couldnt
do that today (laughs).
But I remember that he was usually with Clarks (band).
And I
used to be, became a regular sub; for example, Clark had a job in Baron, Club Baron,
which was in Harlem--uh, it couldve been 130th and Lennox, it couldve been 135 and
Lennox, Im not quite sure--that was around there.
They used to have a place called
Smalls Paradise and I played there a couple times with Marianos quartet.
But this was
in) much later years and Clark had a ... played at the Club Baron.
This was also, the
stage was upstairs, you know (chuckles), but whats interesting, those days, really,
because you see the same faces, you know, two, three times a week.
I think a drink was
somewhere like 80 cents or so, and there was no cover charge or anything.
And they
would tell you, said, "Well, you sound good tonight!
" or they said, "You sounded better
last night!
"

1234
Brown:
1235
 (Laughs)



1236
Akiyoshi:
1237
 (Laughs) And it was like ... it was ... you cant, you dont have that today,
you know.
You dont have that kind of rapport.
First of all, going one time to a jazz club
today, you are looking at, two people, you are looking at close to $100.
So, things like
that ... its something that you go to listen to some group that you like, and one time.
You know, you dont keep going for two or three times.
You cant ... economically, its
not feasible.
So it was a very different scene in those days from today.
Anyways ...
when I started going with Lew, and we decided to get married, at that time Lew was
working with The Tonight Show band.

1238
Brown:
1239
 Yep.
That year was 1969?
That correct?

1240
Akiyoshi:
1241
 Uh, 69, 70.

1242
Brown:
1243
 Okay.

1244
Akiyoshi:
1245
 70, no, no, 70, 71, around then.

1246
Brown:
1247
 Thats when you got...?

1248
Akiyoshi:
1249
 Because he had ... Doc Severinsen had a small band to go up, so he was a
member of that, had like six singers or something, that kind of thing.
And uh, and then
they moved to Los Angeles.
So that brought us to move to Los Angeles, 72, summer.
And, at that time I decided I was going to quit because I, because ...
I didnt really make
any impact, you know.
I tried hard, I had my concert, got a good review and everything,
but it didnt really change my life.
And uh ... so I decided maybe I should quit, because
the world doesnt need another piano player, you know (chuckles).

1250
Brown:
1251
 But, but, Toshiko-san, didnt you go to Japan again, for Expo 1970, before you
went to move to Los Angeles?

1252
Akiyoshi:
1253
 Oh yes, the 1970 Expo (in saka), there was, the music director, the name was
Miss Watanabe, and Watanabe Productions, very big production (company), and she ...
that (was) more like a real pops--you know, what Japanese call "talent" (tarento),
because television and blah, blah, blah kind of things.
She always said, "I respect (what)
you do, but its not, you know, not for my production.
" So when she was assigned to be
music director of the festival, and she called me up, she said, you know, "I can have you
for this," so this is good.
Thats how I was invited, for quartet.
And that time there was a
group (that) came from France, too, uh, Daniel Humair, I remember, he was the drummer
at that time, uh, came to Ja... saka, you know, World Fair.
And uh, I had Lew, myself,
Mickey Roker, and Lews very good friend called, um, Bob, Bob, Bob ...
I will think (of
it) in a minute.


1254
Brown:
1255
 Bass?
On bass?

1256
Akiyoshi:
1257
 Yes, bass.

1258
Brown:
1259
 Bob Cranshaw?

1260
Akiyoshi:
1261
 No, no, hes very active, but this man is ... more or less stopped playing, uh, I
would think.
But, the four of us.
And we just went for ...
I dont think hes a very noted
person.
Um, I will ask Lew.

1262
Brown:
1263
 Not Bob Hurst, though.

1264
Akiyoshi:
1265
 Huh?

1266
Brown:
1267
 Bob Hurst?

1268
Akiyoshi:
1269
 No, no.

1270
Brown:
1271
 Bobs too young.

1272
Akiyoshi:
1273
 No, it isnt, no.
Daugherty!
Bob Daugherty.

1274
Brown:
1275
 Bob Daugherty, uh huh, okay.

1276
Akiyoshi:
1277
 Bob Daugherty , Bob Daugherty, and he was the one.
He was kind of a friend
of Lew and so on.
So we were there just for the, that fair, world fair.

1278
Brown:
1279
 One event?

1280
Akiyoshi:
1281
 No, I think we played maybe three days or something like that.
I dont quite
remember.
But it wasnt one ... but just in and out for that, we didnt have any tour or
anything.
So that was 70.
And ... that was the first time Lew had been in Japan, and for
a very hot August, summer.
Very, very hot and very unpleasant.

1282
Brown:
1283
 (Chuckles)

1284
Akiyoshi:
1285
 So, anyway.
So that was the first ... and then, as I said, it was 72, he ... and
uh....
I was, as I said, I was going to quit, I decided.
So I burned everything: my folder
for the PR, you know, things like that, they were union things.
I burned everything and I
decided....



1286
Brown:
1287
 (Incredulous) You said you burned everything?

1288
Akiyoshi:
1289
 Yeah, so, I was going to quit.
So dah, dah, dah, so we left--you know, my
child, she was at the second grade by that time--anyway, we moved (in) July 72.
And
we were staying at Leonard Feathers home til I found some, we found some apartment
or so on.
And uh, we found a house in nearby Burbank, where he had to go (to) work,
because he doesnt drive and I had to take him, so it had to be near Burbank....

1290
Brown:
1291
 Lew doesnt drive?

1292
Akiyoshi:
1293
 No, he doesnt.
He doesnt drive, so Im the driver (laughs).
Anyway, then,
shortly after we moved, Jimmy Lyons, who was a producer at that time at the....

1294
Brown:
1295
 Monterey (Jazz Festival).

1296
Akiyoshi:
1297
 Monterey, and he called me, said, "John wants you to be in part of a piano
playhouse.
" And uh, because John Lewis was the director at that time, the music
director.
And that kept me ... stopped me from ... quitting.
So I had a few times like
that before, because Joe Termini offered me (a job) to play solo, so this was ... John
offered me the playhouse.
That time it was Billy Taylor, John Lewis, and Erskine
Hawkins, and myself.
There was that ... and I, this was the first time I played Monterey.
Id never played Monterey before.
So that saved my career, so to speak, and John was....
So anyway, he was a very important person in my life, and I didnt know him then, not
much, but he used to come to--I think I mentioned before--when I was a soloist at the
Top of the Gate, he used to come around quite often.
But I just said "Hello," and thats
about all.
So I got to know him after that, and found out he loves wine and, you know,
and I collect wine.
So, he became a very good friend.
His wife Mirjana Lewis is an
accomplished, a very accomplished harpsichord player, and uh, also a wonderful cook.
So Lew and I would go to their home, or they would come to our house, and so on, and
became very, very good friends.
But he was really ... little things like that kept me alive.
He used to say, he said, um, "When people identify with your music, you should always
play it.
You should always play it.
" And he said, "In my case, I think its Django.
"
Thats what he said.
So he said that he always played "Django.
" So, my case, it was
Long Yellow Road," I guess.
So ... in Japan, they always say, if I dont play that, some
fan will say, "I dont feel like I heard you," so they kinda expect me to play that.
So I
always play that.
Lew calls it my signature tune.
But John was really helpful to me.
And one time he said, uh, "You know, why dont you write a tenor lead?
" cause he
played, when we were there he played a record, it was Coleman Hawkins playing the
lead.
I dont quite remember the music, though, tune, but....
So I had a couple of music
pieces) that were tenor leads, and uh, so that was a little bit different, you know, gives a
different color, so to speak.
So ...
I think I was also very much influenced by--because
when I used to listen to Modern Jazz Quartet, when it came out, first came out when I


was still in Japan--he was still playing standards.
The first one (The Quartet, Savoy MG
 had "All the Things You Are," things like that, it was very different, and nothing
like ... you know, I mentioned before, I was into Bud Powell, and this was like totally
different.
And it was so European and I felt like ... (sighs) "Maybe this man would like
to become a European.
"

1298
Brown:
1299
 (Chuckles)

1300
Akiyoshi:
1301
 So ... after we became very good friends, Lew and I had our twenty-fifth
anniversary, and I figured, "Well, we wont have a fiftieth anniversary, so maybe well
have a big party.
" So we had a party at the Essex House, and invited a few people, and
so on, and of course, John and his wife.
And on occasions like that, people make a
speech, you know.
And so John stood up and he said, "Toshiko infused, employed,
infused Japanese culture, so I dont have to do it.
" And he said that.
And then I, thats
when I realized, thats what hed been trying to do.
Because everybody knows jazz is a
fusion between European and African culture, born in this country, but he really wanted
to have more universality, I mean, more European culture into.... Of course, his wife
came from uh, the uh, now its gone ... uh, what do you call, separated in two....

1302
Brown:
1303
 Yugoslavia?

1304
Akiyoshi:
1305
 Yugoslavia.
So things like that had a lot to do with it.
But also his music, you
know, he was ... more, becoming more, more and more like a universal (??
), so on.
I
realized my thinking was so shallow, and so....
He really um ... highly ... thought of me
as, some of the music that I have, like "Kogun," for example, or "Minamata".... You
know, he actually used "Kogun" as material, teaching material at Harvard when he was
teaching (in the) summer.
I have nothing but fond memories, and then I have ... today,
you know, I have, I like to have two sides: I still have, heavily, I have a lot of influence
from Bud Powell, I think I do--but I probably dont play like (as well as) him--but also I
have a lot of influence from John, the fact (is), I like to have both.
John was a very
economized player, meaning each note has meaning, has a heavy, heavy weight, a lot of
weight, and thats something I would like to be able to do.
So I like to have both sides.
So hes been a very good ... uh, teacher, in a sense, so.... Ive been very, I think lucky.
The fact is I came to this country when the music scene was still very open.
Not like
productions are like today, so you could sit in, if you know the tune, you could sit in, and
most of the tunes I knew.
So, thats the best lesson you can get, you know, playing with
great players.
And they were very nice to me and very supportive.
I came at a very good
time, and I think that is my asset.

1306
Brown:
1307
 Well, you brought up two very important, uh, uh, things that we should try to
discuss in more detail.
One is influence, you know, what you were saying is, looking at
cultural influences in music....



1308
Akiyoshi:
1309
 Yes.

1310
Brown:
1311
 ...and then also looking at the formation of your first orchestra.
So....

1312
Akiyoshi:
1313
 Oh?

1314
Brown:
1315
 Your first big band, the formation, the creation of your first big band.

1316
Akiyoshi:
1317
 Yes.

1318
Brown:
1319
 How did that come about?
We know that you are now in Los Angeles....

1320
Akiyoshi:
1321
 So, we moved to Los Angeles because of Lews job, in 72, summer.
And Los
Angeles had not much activity there.
You know, I remember Hampton Hawes used to,
we ... shortly after that, Hamp invited us to their home and his wife made a ...
I think I
never had a great taco like that in my life!
Anyway, so he was very, actually,
complaining a bit about the fact that the jazz clubs--for example, there was Dantes in
North Hollywood--but they were more like outlets for studio players, you know.
So he
was pretty much complaining the fact that they werent hiring real jazz players, whose
livelihood depended on playing.
And uh, that place was more like an outlet for studio
players, so that they could play a little bit or something like that.
So, not much (of a) jazz
scene.
Then Lew found out, uh, he was asked, there was a union (that( had a rehearsal
room, and uh, he was asked to ... most of the time those rehearsals were done by the
writers who were trying to get into studios or movie thing or so on, to try out some of the
music.
I think thats what it was.
But ...
I forgot to mention the fact, after the Town Hall
concert, I felt very comfortable, I thought Id like to write for the big band because ...
I
could express more, then, because you have more color, so on.
But there wasnt any
place that--at that time the union in New York didnt have any room; today they do, but
they didnt--and uh, the rehearsal done by (for) this Town Hall concert, for example, the
cheapest place you could get was $30 an hour and you needed three hours and so on.
So,
once you start a band--I really thought, "I wish I could start a band"--but once you start,
you have to keep it, and I really didnt have that kind of money.
So that was that.
So
when we moved to Los Angeles, I wasnt, I had forgotten all about this, and then Lew
came home one day and said, "I know you havent written but about five music
compositions)," which was for the Town Hall, and "Maybe Ill get the musicians, so
maybe well play your music," you know.
It was something to do; so he was very
frustrated with not much jazz scene, so I think he wanted to be close to that.
So ... those
days, 50 cents for two hours and 45 minutes at the union.
Now its $5.00 (chuckles).

1322
Brown:
1323
 (Chuckling) Fifty cents!


1324
Akiyoshi:
1325
 But 50 cents, so I said, "Well, thats, we can afford it.
" Thats how it started
in 1973, spring.
And he got all the musicians, and it was a ... took about six months to
settle down.
Some musicians didnt want to put up with the music; some musicians, I
didnt think were appropriate, you know, so on, blah, blah, blah.
So thats how the band
started, not as a working band.
It was just to get together and so on, and I thought if I
could probably develop my repertoire and I was kind of getting my, more and more ...
its kind of hard to explain, because you dont really come to a conclusion overnight, you
know.
Sleep and then it was, "Yeah, thats what Im going to do," no.
But the many,
many years I kind of felt like I really wanted to express, maybe, a point of view, my point
of view, not just ... theres a tune and you improvise on (it), you know, having a good
time, nothing like that.
But thats--nothing wrong with it--but I wanted to ... my point
of view, for example, because Im very interested and Im very ... susceptible to social
issues.
Which is, most of the time, social conditions many times were dictated or geared
by government policy.
So, all those things have always been part of my interest, and I
wanted to ... see, Id like to think this one is, I think this way.
If I were a writer, I would
write in words, but because Im a jazz musician, so I like to spell it out in jazz music.
So,
I would start thinking like that, you know, and....
So when Lew suggested we do that,
and then I thought this was a good opportunity for me to ... so meanwhile--this was
-Im sorry, 73.
And in 73 we started, and uh ... going every Wednesday morning
from 10:15 to.... And doing this, I accumulated a little at a time, the music and so on.
And they were coming, everyone ... and I started thinking, "Ive got to give them
something.
Theyre giving me, you know, to play my music," so I thought maybe Id....
I knew some recording producer in Japan--basically he was a classical recording
producer--but he was a good friend of mine.
So I wrote and said this was happening and
would he be interested in recording.
So he said he would be interested in recording.
So
in 1974, I think, Duke died.

1326
Brown:
1327
 Mm-hmm.

1328
Akiyoshi:
1329
 And uh, after Duke died, broom-broom-broom....

1330
Brown:
1331
 Harry Carney died, everybody (chuckles).

1332
Akiyoshi:
1333
 It was like following him, so to speak, like that.
And uh, Nat Hentoff had
written sort of a memoir or memories of Duke in, I think it was Village Voice, and uh,
when I read that and it.... You know, sometimes the little things have to be triggers and
he was talking about how Duke was, how proud Duke was of being a black American,
and his music (was) based on his race, a lot of em, you know: "Black Butterfly," what
have you, "Black and Beige (Tan) Fantasy," so on, blah, blah, blah.
And even (if) you
know it, still somebody said that.
And that triggered me to, I should look (at) my
heritage, cause um ... the normal belief in Japan was, to be Japanese and play jazz was a
handicap.
Thats the way, that was the normal thinking.
And uh, I was thinking, I said,


so when I read it I said, "Well, Im a jazz player; Ive been playing since I was sixteen
years old, and so on, blah, blah.
Im not a bad player, I have probably more experience
than a lot of young American players, but I have a different heritage.
" And uh, "I look at
my heritage as my asset rather than my handicap, and maybe I can bring something into
jazz tradition," which it was, Japanese culture never was part of that.
Maybe I could try
to infuse something; maybe that would be my job.
So, thats what triggered me, and at
the same time, there was a Japanese soldier was discovered in the Philippine jungle.
It
was nearly thirty years, he didnt know the war was ended.
In fact, I think he has written
a book--its a very interesting book.
But anyway--Lt. Onoda, Second Lieutenant Onoda
Hiro)--and I was writing for the flute piece.
I needed a flute piece for the recording.
And uh, and also at the same time, my father was a student of n play--I think I
mentioned that earlier--and he used to, also he was a student of tsuzumi, which is a
Japanese four-headed (drum).
And I always liked the sound, you know.
Actually, I like
all drums, I guess, but I really liked that sound, and I was thinking itd be really nice to
use that, you know.
So I thought Id like to use that, maybe it would be great with the
flute, and ... so I had a tape sent from Japan.
This was like a demonstration tape, a
demonstration tape for the tsuzumi playing.
And they have all kinds of ways of playing;
this was the Kanze (-ry) style of playing (chuckles).

1334
Brown:
1335
 (Chuckles)

1336
Akiyoshi:
1337
 N players, you know, so they showed....
I took ...
It took me ... boy, ten
years to put them together in one segment, so that would be ... and it was music, fit to the
music, where they fall and so on.
And that was "Kogun," came as "Kogun.
" And when I
did that and we recorded this on eight-track....

1338
Brown:
1339
 A-track (chuckles).

1340
Akiyoshi:
1341
 Eight-track.
Very low budget and eight-track, and in a place called Sage &
Sound Studio, in Hollywood, that was nearby (chuckles).
Anyway, uh ... when I wrote
this one and on the way through we did, I thought it was ... Japan, they were gonna put
me down, you know, they were really gonna.... Because Japanese jazz fans, they want,
more of purist (approach).
One, they like small groups--I dont blame them, I feel (the)
same way (chuckles).
And, two, they dont like, you know, theyre purists, they like ...
something like that--Japanese, you know, drums or what have you--"whats this?!
" you
know.
They, I thought they were really gonna put me down, and I thought, "Well, go
ahead and put me down.
I dont really care.
" So thats what I ... and that became an all-
time seller.
My records never sold (laughing) til that time!

1342
Brown:
1343
 (Chuckles)

1344
Akiyoshi:
1345
 One and, this one was a big band!
One, two, thats something that no one had


ever done before, and no one ever heard something like that.
And both (were) against,
you know, sales, but it became (an) all-time seller.
The first sale was, I think, it was
000.
So, you know, jazz in those days, if you sold 5,000, it was considered good.

1346
Brown:
1347
 Still today (laughs).

1348
Akiyoshi:
1349
 So (chuckles) ... so that was--and I was really surprised, wow!--so that was
my milestone.

1350
Brown:
1351
 1974, Kogun, mm-hmm.

1352
Akiyoshi:
1353
 And I thought, "I wish Duke were alive.
I wonder what he would say?
" I was
thinking about that.
Duke was always very uh, ... grandeur.
He came a couple of times
to the (Berklee) school when I was at school, and I had a terrible cold.
And he would say
deep, elegant voice), "Oh, poor child.
My dear, I have to send you to my doctor.
"

1354
Brown:
1355
 (Chuckles)

1356
Akiyoshi:
1357
 You know (chuckling), things like that, he was....

1358
Brown:
1359
 Well, a couple of things that have come up.
First of all, I just want to fill in
some details: where was the rehearsal facility that you used, in what part of L.A.?
Was it
in North Hollywood, or was it in Burbank, or...?

1360
Akiyoshi:
1361
 Youre talking about in Los Angeles.

1362
Brown:
1363
 Yes.

1364
Akiyoshi:
1365
 It was the union.

1366
Brown:
1367
 It was the union hall, okay.

1368
Akiyoshi:
1369
 Union.
47, Local 47 union, and they had a rehearsal room.
And New York
didnt have it.
And as I said, it was 50 cents; today I think its $5.00.

1370
Brown:
1371
 But was it located downtown, or was it located where you were living?

1372
Akiyoshi:
1373
 No, Vine Street.

1374
Brown:
1375
 Vine Street.
You know where it is?

1376
Akiyoshi:
1377
 Uh, I guess thats North Hollywood.


1378
Brown:
1379
 You know where it is, okay.
So it hasnt changed, its still there, same place.

1380
Akiyoshi:
1381
 Yes, same place.
Its still there.

1382
Brown:
1383
 Okay.
And, more importantly, um ... blending in the tsuzumi sound: did you
have any kind of harmonic or tonal considerations?
Or what was your thought process in
blending it into the jazz orchestra?

1384
Akiyoshi:
1385
 No.
No, because they usually, fairly ... they dont have like a high-tone; but
they usually have a certain sound.
Theyre usually more or less the same.
They always
work in pairs: the one is ko-tsuzumi, small one....

1386
Brown:
1387
 On the shoulder, mm-hmm.

1388
Akiyoshi:
1389
 ...which goes on the shoulder; and the big one goes on the hip....

1390
Brown:
1391
 -tsuzumi, mm-hmm.

1392
Akiyoshi:
1393
 ...and oddly enough, the big ... small one makes a lower sound, the bigger
one makes the high sound.
And they always work together.
And I always liked the
sound, you know, so this was something that the first time I used.
And when, uh, I had
other ones, for example, "Minamata," for example, Kanze (Hisao)--we call it iemoto, the
one at the head of that particular style of n, you know, singing--hes deceased, but I
asked him to sing it for me, for this particular song, um, music.
So it was ... the tsuzumi
sound is pretty much the same, all things.
I think if you hear, maybe three or four
different n plays and if you hear that sound, its pretty much the same.

1394
Brown:
1395
 Yes, but you know--as probably you and I know, maybe some people who hear
this--in n drama, the tsuzumi players also have kakegoe (literally "hung voice"), right?
The vocalization: OOOooooh (mimics).

1396
Akiyoshi:
1397
 Yes.

1398
Brown:
1399
 So that's what Im talking about.

1400
Akiyoshi:
1401
 Oh, they make the great sounds to concentrate ... uh, the energy, then hit (the
drum).
And always the small tsuzumi player does that.
And the smallest, er, the biggest
one, they usually have a short, very short, low note sound.
They go (low voice) oooooh,
something like that.
But the one who makes the long, high-pitched (call), thats to
concentrate the energy, then they play.
The good players sound really, really nice on it.
They, uh ... have a Japanese paper, thats cut in a little bit, and they put that on the other


side (of the drum) to change the pitch the way they like, at the point where they like.
Thats what they do.
But as I always, you know.... Anyways, so that was my milestone.

1402
Brown:
1403
 So when you make the recording, but how can you tour this?
You have to take
these artists with you to tour, to tour, to recreate this piece when youre touring.

1404
Akiyoshi:
1405
 I have a tape.

1406
Brown:
1407
 (Laughs) Ha!

1408
Akiyoshi:
1409
 But twice we had real players, in Japan.
That was a luxury.
And also here at
the concert ... uh, uh ... the one time was at Carnegie Hall (recorded and released as
Carnegie Hall Concert by Columbia in 1991), and then another time at Sankei Hall in
Japan, they had a real player.
But most of the time, for example, we used to play every
Monday night at Birdland in New York, and every Monday night, and I had a tape
recorder set for that and prerecorded.
So, yeah, thats ... you know, if you are a classical
organization, you can afford to have, their budget will provide it, even though its like a
twenty-minute piece of music and all you need is one note (chuckles), they will, that
musician was hired.
We dont have that kind of luxury, so....

1410
Brown:
1411
 So now, Id presume that you look at 1974 as a ... this is now the land--, this is
the turning point in your career.
Do you now feel that you were successful as a jazz
musi-- did the success of Kogun...?

1412
Akiyoshi:
1413
 I think I did (to) some degree, yes, I do.
I have--as far as music is
concerned--I have close to 100 pieces of composition.
And uh, the most important, to
me, I think, probably the important music compositions would be ... they all have
Japanese kind of ... herita--Japanese culture is weaved in.
And also one is Hiroshima:
Rising from the Abyss (2001), that one has a Korean flute player (Won Jang-hyun,
playing taegm), who was also employed, so it has....
But Ive always preferred ... Im
very careful, Ive always been very careful.
In other words, there are many music--
especially nowadays in Japan--said, well, put Japanese culture (in).
Somehow, its not,
in my mind, its not working in all respects.
When you use something that wasnt there
before, you have to be very careful: its like ... you still ... somebody listens to it and
says, "That is jazz music, but its a little bit different.
" You know, some different color.
I think its coloring: Japanese culture, you can only do coloring, not like some, like,
Brazilian music, you know, took over the jazz scene at one point.
But not like that, just
coloring.
But it is like, has to be ... for example, if you eat something, something that
doesnt belong, like a stone or whatever it is, and (gets) stuck in your throat, and it ... it
cant be like that.
Music has to be something without any uh ... problem, any um, ...
teik, um ... resistance ... it has to go natural, natural in the ear.
And just like something
unnatural in there, something there that doesnt belong there, its gonna (get) stuck.
And


it shouldnt be like that.
So, (you) have to be very, very careful, which is, I think I have
been very careful.
So there was Hiroshima, thats ... "Minamata" is.... "Minamata"
from Insights, 1976) actually ... uh, Down Beat, gained their album of the year, which
was very nice.
It was a long time ago.

1414
Brown:
1415
 Mm-hmm.

1416
Akiyoshi:
1417
 Anyway, that and ... most things....
I have even, some of the things that are
very, very old-fashioned, its called "Relaxing at the Zell am See," not the Camarillo
laughs).

1418
Brown:
1419
 (Laughs)

1420
Akiyoshi:
1421
 But um--Zell am See, which is a famous ski resort in uh, Switzerland, uh ...
no, Austria, excuse me, Austria.

1422
Brown:
1423
 Mm-hmm.

1424
Akiyoshi:
1425
 And uh, it has real old-fashioned music, you know.
In the middle of it there is
a woodwind (passage) and theres uh ... tsuzumi, and it worked out very good.
You
know, there was ... Lew said, "If you can swing that, Ill buy you dinner.
" So, he had to
buy dinner!
(laughs)

1426
Brown:
1427
 (Laughs) Well, sounds like you were, uh, very conscious, and even concerned,
about the audience reception your music, particularly in Japan, by integrating these
Japanese elements into your music.

1428
Akiyoshi:
1429
 No, I wasnt concerned.
As I said, I felt like they were going to put me down.

1430
Brown:
1431
 Yeah.

1432
Akiyoshi:
1433
 And I didnt really care.

1434
Brown:
1435
 Right.

1436
Akiyoshi:
1437
 I said, "Go ahead.
"

1438
Brown:
1439
 What about your concept about how the American audience would receive your
music?

1440
Akiyoshi:
1441
 How...?


1442
Brown:
1443
 Did you have any idea, or any concern about Americans receiving your music?

1444
Akiyoshi:
1445
 Not really.
I ... of course, I hoped people would find, would identify with the
music.
Thats the way we get uh ... you know, reputation or highly regarded, or
whatever it is.
But, (the) main things to me always been--for my entire career, whole
career--it is, I have to be very, very true to me.
Im the first listener, as far as the
writings concerned.
Im the first listener.
So if this wont ...
I want to convey certain
.. some music is, as you know--"Kogun," too, but there was "Minamata" and
Hiroshima"--all those are like programmatic music, which Duke used to write, but not
that many, you know.
Uh, and that means you have a message: you have a story to tell.
And that message has to be in to the listener, the correct way, and in order to do that, Im
the first listener.
So I have to be able to identify with the music.
How (do) I do that?
Thats the way the work is, its from the back.
And ... main thing is always, I have to be
true to me, and hopefully people will identify with the music.
But if Im not true to my
music, Im not worthy.
I mean, all these years of playing, you know, all the work will be
wasted.
So I always think like that, you know.

1446
Brown:
1447
 Just like you say that Japanese jazz fans are more purist, they want to have
authentic jazz, right?
Coming from America.
They presume that jazz is an American
music, and the authentic music is from America?
Authentic jazz?

1448
Akiyoshi:
1449
 Im not quite sure about (if) authentic is the right word.
I think they dont
really heard ... now that they dont, you know, they have great respect for me.
But the
point is, never done it before.
And they always ... the mainstream jazz fan is usually
interested in the individual players, which I agree.
I feel the same way.
And uh, so, but,
when youre writing for a large ensemble, theres an old way of saying, "A band is a
book is a book is a book.
" So its composition, which is not exactly how many ...
improvisation will be limited, and the whole compos-- it goes into a different category,
you know, I think.
And uh, but at the same time, it is like, player and writing, its like a
jockey and a horse.
Like Duke never had a tenor solo til Ben Webster joined the band,
so theres always, the great bands--like Basies was well known, it was (because of) Pres
Lester Young)--you know, always you have to have a great player.
Otherwise the
music doesnt have ... that highest ... uh, how do you say?
... high merit as music, jazz
music.
So there was a ... long time ago there was a discussion in Japan--I was still in
Japan--can you call (it) jazz if they have no improvisation at all, and it was all ensemble?
But its swing, its called....
But I think you can call it jazz, but at the same time, its not
very attractive, you know, its not very attractive.
Because if the improvisation is the
only merit of jazz, theres a lot of em, and all this.
You know, concerto of cadenza for
Isaac) Stern was improvised, everything like that.
So, there was a lot of those ...
European music has all that.
But as Duke says, you know, "it dont mean a thing if it
aint got that swing"....



1450
Brown:
1451
 (Chuckles)

1452
Akiyoshi:
1453
 ...so thats a part of it, you know, thats the way....

1454
Brown:
1455
 Right.
Well, I think youre bringing up the issue that jazz is more than just any
one particular element or any one thing.
It is a lot of different things: its swing, its
blues, maybe a blues-base, its improvisation, many different things.
But I want to talk to
you because, when I listen to The Carnegie Hall Concert, 1991, the piece for the children
"Children of the Universe"), which is, I believe, Hiroshima....

1456
Akiyoshi:
1457
 Oh yes.

1458
Brown:
1459
 ...I hear the way youre voicing the orchestra: its almost like the whole
orchestra is acting almost like, from gagaku (music of Japanese imperial court), you have
like the, what I consider severe portamento (sings), its almost like hichiriki (double-reed
bamboo flute) to me.

1460
Akiyoshi:
1461
 Yes.

1462
Brown:
1463
 So....

1464
Akiyoshi:
1465
 Hichiriki is a little different, but I know what you mean.
But "Children of the
Universe," that one, uh ... that ...
I kind of like that melody.
Its kind of like (sings)
teee-ah--ta, but ... that one is like, is probably more like explanatory.
First you start
with flute and tsuzumi.
So you hear very traditional Japanese, because Japanese think its
bending a note, you know, and uh ... and a tsuzumi player.
And you hear that, then when
the band comes in, the same melody, but uh ... they would have different ... uh ... cause
its harmony on top.
Its different, you hear different things: the melody is there, but you
know when it comes to the bridge, thats when the tempo starts and then the bridge, and
right there its just the old-fashioned jazz music, the ballad, like that.

1466
Brown:
1467
 Right.
But it sounds like youre mixing in--through phrasing, also some of the
chords, the way the chord, you know, sustained chords--to me sounds like sh (mouth
organ) and then like hichiriki.
Not really, exactly, to imitate, but use some of the idea of,
you know, the phrasing, so....

1468
Akiyoshi:
1469
 Oh yes.
The first one was "Sumi-e."

1470
Brown:
1471
 Mm-hmm.

1472
Akiyoshi:
1473
 That one I had written for the 67 concert ... you know, 1967 Town Hall
concert.
It was called "Sumi-e" and that was, I was writing in the middle--as I


mentioned before--from 12 oclock to 6 in the morning I was writing.
And uh ...
somehow I started hearing this gagaku sound and uh ... it took me quite an effort, but
that was played by trumpets.
Because I used to hear Japanese trumpet players bend a
note, you know.
And so thats whats typical Japanese gagaku sound: in other words,
two together, two together, like this.
And ... comes up top, while the melodys still
going, the same thing, now that was a very repetitious melody, keep going and third time
they have these things, weaving comes in.
And uh, I think it worked out well, but thats
the first time I did that, you know.
And when the first time with the band--Lew got the
musicians together in the band in Los Angeles--first time we rehearsed, the trumpet
players were saying, "We cant bend the notes.
" I said, "Oh yes you can, because Ive
seen Japanese trumpet players do it, so if Japanese can do (it), you can do (it)"
chuckles).

1474
Brown:
1475
 Miles Davis did it all the time.

1476
Akiyoshi:
1477
 But thats one of ... very first one.
But uh, the one ... um, the tribute to Duke
Ellington, that was commissioned by the Monterey (Jazz) Festival, 1999.
You were
there.
And the second movement, which is "Eulogy," it was, the start was the same
thing: gagaku.
And it was like that.
And it was ... when the tenor comes in, it was a real
ballad, in my mind.
Its like, almost like, "Whats happened?
" like this.
But it was, the
second time you play you get into....
So theres an introduction that seems to ... and
when you repeat theres something added, next time you repeat theres something added.
Something, and it comes to a certain point, and it comes to a very traditional ... whatever.
It takes ... takes a lot of effort, but uh, thats what the writers supposed to do, you know.
Im not writing for a jingle!
(chuckles)

1478
Brown:
1479
 (Chuckles)

1480
Akiyoshi:
1481
 Im not facing a deadline.
So I always felt like Im fortunate to have the kind
of situation that I could take all the time in the world, so that I can always correct it if I
didnt think it was right.
That's the thing about the writing: you know, you playing and
you cant correct it.
I say, "Oh dear, why did I do that!
Its gone!
" (laughs)

1482
Brown:
1483
 (Laughs) You know, when I think of other artists, particularly composers and
musicians who are blending East, or Japanese, and Western concepts, I think of Tru
Takemitsu.
I dont know if youre familiar with....

1484
Akiyoshi:
1485
 Yes, yes.

1486
Brown:
1487
 ...because he was already blending not only concepts--

1488
Akiyoshi:
1489
 Yes, yes.


1490
Brown:
1491
 ...the way, the structure of the music--but also traditional Japanese instruments.

1492
Akiyoshi:
1493
 We were very good friends, because he really liked jazz.
When he got the ...
fellowship from--I forget the name, it was a famous one and all--he said he wanted to
study with Duke Ellington, and they thought he was joking.
You know, I mean, its a
real snob, classical field, but....

1494
Brown:
1495
 I think Richard Stoltzman said this in an interview in Down Beat: that--I think it
was a Fulbright scholarship....

1496
Akiyoshi:
1497
 Fulbright, yes, thats it.

1498
Brown:
1499
 ...in the late fifties--and they thought he was going to choose Copland, or, you
know, some other more classical composer, and he said no, Duke Ellington, and they just
.. and I think they withdrew it.

1500
Akiyoshi:
1501
 No, I dont think John Coltrane was there at that time, yet, that time, I dont
think he was.
I dont think so.

1502
Brown:
1503
 Oh, I didnt say ... no, I didnt mean ...
I didnt say John Coltrane (chuckles),
no, no.

1504
Akiyoshi:
1505
 Oh, oh, okay, sorry.
But anyway....

1506
Brown:
1507
 I said Aaron, Aaron Copland.

1508
Akiyoshi:
1509
 Oh, yes, right.
Thats what they said and it was ... but he, he wanted to, so....
But his November Steps is the classic one and he liked to use the biwa (lute, similar to
Chinese pipa)....

1510
Brown:
1511
 And shakuhachi (bamboo flute).

1512
Akiyoshi:
1513
 ...but he was such a sensitive writer.
He--I think we might have been the
same age, Im not quite sure (Takemitsu was born in 1930, ten months after Akiyoshi)--
he was a very frail person and drank quite a lot, so he had to be very careful about eating
and so on.
And he said, one time he said, "Well, why dont we write together?
"

1514
Brown:
1515
 Hmm!

1516
Akiyoshi:
1517
 And I said (sheepishly), "Well, I dont know.
" I cant write what he does, and
he cant write what I do.
You know (chuckles), thats what I was thinking, but he was....


My unfortunate thing was the last time we were having a temper and I said--because he
was writing a lot of movie music--and uh, "Do you like writing movie music?
" and he
said, "Oh, yes!
" So ... one thing is I remember Kaidan, Japanese (movie) Kaidan
1964)--that changed the whole movie background music and he was kind of
revolutionary with things--but he started writing some for American, you know, movies
and so on, blah, blah, blah, but if he didnt do that, he wouldve done more ... music for
listening.
Its not what we call "cue writing," not that, but we would have more
Takemitsu music, you know, I think about (that).
But somebody said he really loved
movies, so it was kind of, it was natural that he wanted to write for movies.
But uh ...
hes one of the, I think, maybe one or two Japanese composers who actually comes down
to the, you know, level, the international level, as a contemporary writer.
Very, very
sensitive writer.

1518
Brown:
1519
 (Receives cue from recording engineer) Okay.
So, Toshiko-san, were talking a
lot about now, as composer....

1520
Akiyoshi:
1521
 Yes.

1522
Brown:
1523
 ...I think that you have really changed, uh ... youve had an impact on the
vocabulary of jazz and tonal color, by bringing in the cultural elements from Japan.
Um,
but obviously you have a great regard and love for some of the people who came before
you, like in 1978, you made a recording dedicated to Billy Strayhorn (Tribute to Billy
Strayhorn, released in 1982 on Jazz America).

1524
Akiyoshi:
1525
 Oh yes!

1526
Brown:
1527
 So, talk about, you know, Strayhorn, please.

1528
Akiyoshi:
1529
 I think that was a trio, my playing on....
I think Strayhorn is some-- ... his
music, I wish I could really digest well.
Somehow, his music had a more ... different, uh
.. dimension.
I mean, Duke was always a great writer, but his music is more, uh ...
suited with singing, maybe, to words, and so on.
But I think Dukes greatness was
probably orchestration.
(??
Track begins in mid-sentence with syllable ui , possibly
the Japanese term for sad, gloomy), you know, a Japanese, it has a ... its a more
different dimension; his music is something (that) has ... for example--let me thinking
about the things, you know.
The music would, say, "Isfahan" really sounds like there
Iran); and things like "Lush Life," where its ... "Daydream" is something that
Strayhorns family, somehow they heard the record and they really liked the way I
played, so I tried to listen to what they liked about it.
Im only playing very short
laughs), I didnt realize I played so short.
Thats such a long time ago, you know, over
twenty some-odd years ago.
But his music was something that ... for example, Lew
plays it really well.
I wish I could digest it really well.
Many of his music (pieces) let me


think about certain things, that particular music.
Its not hunky-dory, happy-happy, or
anything like that.
It was, of course, his last one, "Blood Count," it really sounds like a
blood count, you know.
Hes one of probably ...
I always thought he was like as great a
jazz writer as Monk, but Strayhorn has ... one doesnt have to be a jazz musician to
appreciate or understand or, you know, the music.
For Monks music, you kind of have
to be a jazz connoisseur to appreciate his music, I think.
But Strayhorns is music I
always ... liked and I wish I could--even now--I wish someday, I probably hope to
digest his music and do some justice to his music in my playing.

1530
Brown:
1531
 Well, obviously, as you said, the Strayhorn family saw some, saw your music,
your interpretation of Strayhorn as very, very valuable, so thats great.
You know, when
you were talking earlier about John Lewis and how he brought in a lot of, you know,
Western classical influence....

1532
Akiyoshi:
1533
 Yes.

1534
Brown:
1535
 ...more, I know he loves Bach, you know, and very formal, very formalized, and
more Germanic tradition, whereas Strayhorn, also very much influenced by classical
music, coming more from the French tradition.

1536
Akiyoshi:
1537
 But the difference is, I think, is that John was a player.

1538
Brown:
1539
 Mm-hmm.

1540
Akiyoshi:
1541
 I think--I know Strayhorn played the piano--but hes not noted as a player.
I
know he had a couple recordings, but John Lewis was a player.
Also, (whats) interesting
about John Lewis, his compositions are very European, but ... for example, like, say....
He has written a duet, as you know, with Hank Jones--he respected Hank Jones like
mad!
So although the duet was like traveling, or it has so much European influence; but
when he comes to solo, hes, everything is, his root has always been blues.
Thats what I
think, you know, so thats a very interesting combination.
I think thats one of the
reasons, maybe, when Bags quit--Milt Jackson quit at one point, one time he quit--and
he disbanded (Modern Jazz Quartet), someone, Im sure there were several critical
musicians or whoever who suggested to him, "Why dont you use this guy or that guy,"
you know, great vibraphone players, and so on, but John wouldnt hear of it.
But
because, I think, thats the way he believed, the way music has to be played.
So it is a
difference between he and Strayhorn, in some respects, I think, you know, something like
that.
Of course, Johns music is something like, very clean (laughs)--transparent is not a
good word--its like, but crystal, kind of.
Strayhorns music is darker, to me.
Its more,
like I said, multi-dimensional.
I wish I knew the right words, the right English words for
Johns music, you know, like a certain....



1542
Brown:
1543
 Why dont you say it in Japanese?
Maybe we can get somebody to translate it
later.
Go ahead.

1544
Akiyoshi:
1545
 Yeah?
Uh, tmei ... tmeisei ... tmeisei (transparency, clearness, crystalline),
uh ... tsukitru (penetrating), tmeisei meaning tsukitru, its like something like ... its
like, uh (chuckles, frustrated).
I dont know how to say in English.

1546
Brown:
1547
 Its okay, well....

1548
Akiyoshi:
1549
 Yes, tmeisei, sei is ... um ... thats what I think, Johns music, I always feel
that that has that quality, and.... Its pretty much like, thats the way he plays: he plays
very ... little (few) notes and to some degree its deliberate.
All notes weigh a lot, and I
think thats something that ... in Strayhorns case, thats not his forte.
I wish ... for
example, like, I love Bud Powell, as you know, and I know quite a lot of his music, but
his music is never that ... uh, its mostly, its bebop-oriented, harmonically a little bit
intricate, but its really instrumental music, rather than uh, ... like Strayhorns music--
well, maybe its written on an instrument--but its not really instrumental music.
It is a
composition that is saying something, and thats the difference.
Uh ... hes really a rare,
rare, rare, great writer.

1550
Brown:
1551
 So maybe clarity?
Im not sure thats a good word.
But um, in thinking of, um
.. John Lewis and Billy Strayhorn, influence of European music, um--also the way you
talk, you know, as a composer, also as orchestrator and arranger--theres so many
different things (that) go into shaping the music.
Now, you have somebody like Gil
Evans, who mostly is known as orchestrator, arranger, rather than composer.

1552
Akiyoshi:
1553
 Right.

1554
Brown:
1555
 Uh, could you talk about his music and/or influence, from Gil?

1556
Akiyoshi:
1557
 No, Im not, I really didnt study his music much.
All I know is that he was,
before that he was writing for, I think it was a dance band, I forgot ... Claude Thornhill.

1558
Brown:
1559
 Claude Thornhill.

1560
Akiyoshi:
1561
 And uh, but ... he knew Miles.
I think thats what he has written, orchestrated
for the two (LPs), as you know, Sketches of Spain and others and so on.
But his whole
group--he had it for quite some time--but it didnt really have that kind of impact.
But I
think hes ... (hesitates) I hate to say this--all due respect--he needed Miles to show his
full capabilities as an orchestrator, maybe, you know.
He was a very sensitive writer.
Hes not a ... one of the things I always missed, he was very sensitive, but he didnt have
a real dynamic thing, you know, and it was like, uh ... Duke has it, Frank Fosters music


has it, you know, a real kind of dynamo.
But he had written, I think, arranged,
orchestrated, I think it was strings, um, Bill Evans played?
Its beautifully orchestrated.
Things like that: he was a beautiful orchestrator, I think, very sensitive.
But ... Im not
.. also, this is, I just thought about something that.... Before Gil Evans came out, I think
European writers really couldnt get with it.
They couldnt identify (with) Dukes writing
and Fosters writing, what have you.
And Gil Evans, the way he orchestrated, European
writers, they could identify (with it): "Oh, I can do that.
" I think its a ... in that respect, I
think hes more like a bridge to the European writers.
Some of them came back here,
some American writers, with very European writing.
I dont know if I make sense.

1562
Brown:
1563
 Oh, no, absolutely.

1564
Akiyoshi:
1565
 You know what I mean?

1566
Brown:
1567
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, I mean, uh.... We interviewed Hale Smith.
Do you know
Hale Smith?
Did you...?

1568
Akiyoshi:
1569
 No, Im afraid not.

1570
Brown:
1571
 Oh.
Anyway, hes a classical composer, uh, African American, and he worked
with Eric Dolphy; he also worked with Mingus.
But, he said, yeah, well, Gil Evans, you
can trace the direct influence back to a European classical composition, just like the
Aranjuez, you know, the Concierto, certain things like that, theres already a European
precedent, he just kind of recasts it in a jazz language.
So its true, its a bridge, because
you see the original source, he just recasts it, so....

1572
Akiyoshi:
1573
 Right, thats why I think that, so thats why now a lot of European writers start
writing and pretty much, some of the writers here, Ill say, "That sounds European"
chuckles).
You know, I think about that, something like that.

1574
Brown:
1575
 Well ... even somebody like who we were talking about--John Lewis and Billy
Strayhorn--but even ... you know, so we saw different ways of European classical
influence, you know, concert music influence.
But even Bud Powell wrote a through-
composed piece, "The Glass Enclosure.
" This is not a jazz piece (chuckles).

1576
Akiyoshi:
1577
 No, but, it is not a European piece.

1578
Brown:
1579
 Right.....

1580
Akiyoshi:
1581
 No.

1582
Brown:
1583
 ...but its through-composed (chuckles).


1584
Akiyoshi:
1585
 (Calling to husband) Lew-chan!
Could you do me a favor?
Take the
champagne out from freezer and put it in the fridge.
I dont want them to freeze.
Sorry.

1586
Brown:
1587
 (Laughs) No problem.

1588
Akiyoshi:
1589
 The ...
I think "Glass Enclosure"--one of my favorites, and Ive never played
it, I dont think I can play it--but I heard somebody play it.
But ... if you hear it, even
though no one, if I never heard the piece, and if I hear it, I can tell its Bud.
I can tell its
Bud Powell, because....

1590
Brown:
1591
 How?

1592
Akiyoshi:
1593
 ...its the punctuation, harmonize, also the way he ... you know, he has a very
unique way of punctuating things and always been a very, very muscular player, a real
dynamic player.
And his touch was like that: it was not a, you know, like Teddy Wilson
or somebody like that (chuckles).
He wasnt like that.
I dont consider that to be
European music, in my mind, no.
And also, it may not have the pulse like that, but every
once in a while theres a pulse, you know (sings).
Thats a pulse to me.
Thats like a, its
real ... but it doesnt sound like European music, in my mind.

1594
Brown:
1595
 Mm-hmm.

1596
Akiyoshi:
1597
 But hes ... he wrote so many tunes, but I think they were, they were all very
good.
But its totally different from....
I think what a lot of bebop players have written
is totally different from something like a Strayhorn; bebop isnt a story, telling you
something, not that much.
Charlie Parker has written so many, but theyre riffs, so many,
you know, riffs, da-da-da-da, and so on.
So its not quite the same thing, I think.

1598
Brown:
1599
 Mm-hmm.
Well, it definitely shows some other influence other than strictly
through, uh, through jazz influence.
You know, again, its just getting ... like for
example, I want to ask you some other infl-- you know, you can like somebody; that
doesnt necessarily mean theyre going to influence what you do.

1600
Akiyoshi:
1601
 I, you know, what I think is that as soon as we hear something you like, I think
you are influenced right there.
It may not be....

1602
Brown:
1603
 Conscious?

1604
Akiyoshi:
1605
 ...obvious influence, but its not only music.
But I was very influenced by ...
there was a time when it was called "happening.
I guess the word happening, you know,
they are ... Robert uh, uh ...
Hamburger, you know, big hamburger (chuckles), those


days.
And by watching this, observing, if you have the money, you can put a quarter in
the box.
If you dont, you dont have to.
That kind of thing was going around there,
maybe at the time I was a student living in what they call Soho today.
Those days it
wasnt Soho (chuckles).

1606
Brown:
1607
 (Chuckles)

1608
Akiyoshi:
1609
 Um, but Im very much influenced by things like that, Im sure.
And I like
painting.
I dont understand anything about it, but I like painting.
And by ... anything
that ... you look ... uh ... read, could be observing a social issue--even if it has nothing
to do with music--its a social issue, a political scene, you know, all those things if you
observe it, I think they all influence....
I, personally, I think I was influenced quite by
everything.
Other than that, if its not, I wouldnt be able to, I wouldnt be producing
things like Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss, or "Minamata," or something like that.
Its
coming, maybe not (as) notes, but I ... the message and so on.
So everything I see, or
touch, observe, and if it gave me some kind of feeling, I was influenced right there by,
you know, different meaning, maybe.

1610
Brown:
1611
 Well, lets talk about your piece about Hiroshima, since you talked also about
how you have a political awareness, as well.
So this piece, when you were first
commissioned, you made comments that, that ... something to (the effect), "Why should
I write about this tragedy?
" Whats the connection?

1612
Akiyoshi:
1613
 Yeah, youre talking about the Hiroshima piece.
Well, that was commissioned
by a priest--who was here not too long ago, in New York, with his son--but anyway,
hes a jazz fan.
He has quite many, hes very aware of my music that I have written, uh,
Minamata.
" Thats why he asked me.
It was 1999 and I was in the midst of writing for
the tribute to Duke Ellington and it was--excuse me, 1998--so I told him, "Im kind of
busy," and he said that he would wait, and he sent me a photo ... uh, (mumbles), its
somewhere here.
The photo was taken three days after the bomb was dropped, and, uh--
I mentioned earlier, think yesterday--that I was born and raised in old Manchuria, today
China.
And uh, I never had an air raid experience or anything like that, and then after we
came back to Japan, the whole family in 1946, I started playing immediately in the dance
hall.
And also, at that time, there wasnt much talk about this bomb dropped by the
Americans.
I think, probably, Japanese journalists and government and so on were very
sensitive about not writing things like that: we were, you know, right after the Occupation
time, so I think thats....
So it never even occurred to me.
And then later on, after I came
to this country, I heard news about some of the girls who were victims came here for
treatment (the so-called Hiroshima Maidens).
I heard all that.
But I didnt really think
much of it, to tell you the truth.
So when he gave me this photo, and I was so shocked,
because I had never seen anything like this.
So ...
I wasnt quite sure if I could write
something like this.
And first of all, we were looking at it--that was done in 46, 194--


...

1614
Brown:
1615
 The bombing?
45.

1616
Akiyoshi:
1617
 ...1945, and here we are in, you know, 1998, and, first of all, when that bomb
was dropped, many, many people died, and horrible, horrible ... can you...?
First, does it
have any meaning writing music like that?
And uh, I didnt see much of a purpose in
writing music like that.
I didnt think I could write (it), and I was going to decline.
Then
I was just looking at a page and ... the one page that I missed, it was a young woman
who) was underground, so she wasnt affected, and she came out, and she just looked a
little bit, uh, and smiled a little bit.
And it was such a beautiful face--I know I have a
picture of her somewhere, Ill find it--anyway, uh, and then when I saw that, I said, "I
can write that.
" And it was, also ... even though the photographer who took this photo,
he also has written a series Full of Hope, you know, Face Full of Hope, and it was
definitely a beautiful photo.
I said, "I can write that.
" It was like, we have to have hope
no matter what.
Maybe, more reason you have to have, the more ... horrible the
situation, then you have to have more hope.
Like, uhhhh ... uhhhh ... Lama, great....

1618
Brown:
1619
 Dalai Lama?

1620
Akiyoshi:
1621
 Dalai Lama.
He said, "Well we cant live without hope," which is very true.
And I thought, "Im going to make this more like a piece of anti-war, anti-nuclear
weapon, weapon-anything, and it was ... and we will not ... uh, give up hope that
someday maybe people will tolerate each other (chuckles slightly), and at least theres no
war.
And we keep saying that, we keep just saying that to the world, you know.
That's
the way I wanted to write, and I think thats, thats what I think I wrote.
So its a very
long piece, a 24-, 25-minute piece, and its just ... some of the war, and after the war,
these people with mothers were talking about their ... memories, so on, so on.
And the
very last part, and it was the hope.
This place was a short one, but to me this is the punch
line.

1622
Brown:
1623
 (Chuckles)

1624
Akiyoshi:
1625
 I thought, "Well, this is a piece of hope, so Id like to play it in the 21st
century," and I said, I started writing in 1998, so.... And uh, so we did: 21st (century),
 August 6, in Hiroshima.
Then we had a little tour after that--maybe five or six
concerts--then came back to the United States, and then, of course, after thats 9/11.
I
still remember, that was a Tuesday morning, because we played Monday night, you
know, Monday night, always, and wed just come back from Japan, we had such a ...
I
had a terrible time trying to sleep and so on.
And uh, finally, I had kind of started
sleeping, then the phone rang, from my daughter.
And I heard Lew say, "Really?!
Wow.
" And he went up and put the television on, and I said, "Oh my God, whats he


putting on the television for?
Im sleeping," and I looked, and then already, you know.
So, that was 9/11.
So after that, we always played at the very end of--Monday night, or
even if I play someplace else, it doesnt matter where it is--I always play that "Hope,"
that part, maybe about two minutes or so.
Very short.
So thats what we do in--thats
what I do (laughs)--any, uh, any situation.
No, I think ... you know, you were
mentioning before that, when you have many compositions, which one is your favorite.
People ask that, its just like uh, you were saying, its just asking somebody, "Which of
your children is your favorite?
" and it was....
But its something that probably ...
important compositions for me are probably "Kogun," "Minamata," and Hiroshima,
pieces like that.
And, I would like to think, "Children of the Universe," because that is
.. you know some-- ...
I dont even really listen to music and--jibun, you know, my
own--its a long time passed, maybe a couple of years or so on.
And then I listened to it.
And sometimes, even though at that time I thought it was good--thats why I recorded or
played it or so on--some music is ... gee, I dont know, I mean, uh, a little ... its not that
much impact, some music like that.
And then some music stands, and I think time is the
kind of judgment, judge of the music, I think, you know, the composition.
"Children of
the Universe," and then, I had written that one in 81, or 80, one of those years, and ... it
still stands okay today.
I listen to it.
So I feel very good about (it).
Many times when the
years pass, you know, twenty years later, and I say (sucks breath, sounds anxious), "I
dont know, this maybe ... a little too light-handed," or something like that, so....
I think
those ... all of them are very long (laughs), very long pieces.

1626
Brown:
1627
 (Laughs)

1628
Akiyoshi:
1629
 Its getting longer and longer!

1630
Brown:
1631
 Well, the pieces you mentioned--as you stated earlier--you are a socially
conscious person, its reflected in the music, particularly in the titles you just said were
important to you.
(Takes deep breath) When I look at Duke Ellington, yes, as we talked
earlier, he was very much influenced by his cultural, uh, background.
But also, Duke
Ellington had a very strong spirituality, particularly in his later period.

1632
Akiyoshi:
1633
 Oh, yes, of course.

1634
Brown:
1635
 So, for me that means humanity.
Uh, spirituality means humanity.

1636
Akiyoshi:
1637
 Yes.

1638
Brown:
1639
 So I see that in your music, as well.
Do you feel that theres any kind of cultural
influence in this consciousness of yours?
You mentioned Buddha before; do you feel that
Japanese culture or maybe just your early upbringing has had an impact on the way you
view the world?


1640
Akiyoshi:
1641
 I would like to, I would like to think it does.
I was mentioning earlier, that
anything you observe--it doesnt necessarily have to be music--but it could be anything
you observe and you felt something, right there you are influenced by (it).
So, that
includes everything: political scene, government, policymaking, and social issues, what
have you.
So I would like to think my music will have all that, you know, digested in
myself and comes out.
I would like to think that.

1642
Brown:
1643
 Well, I think your music speaks that, so....

1644
Akiyoshi:
1645
 Thank you.

1646
Brown:
1647
 (Laughing) ...I think you got that covered!
Um ... also, uh ... let me take just a
quick break, just a minute.
Um, here in 2008, its a very interesting year for America: we
have a woman running for president....

1648
Akiyoshi:
1649
 Oh, president, yes.

1650
Brown:
1651
 ...and a black man.
And when I think about your career--again, my mothers
Japanese--I think about her experience.
I know her experience directly, coming to
America, being Japanese, in the aftermath of World War II, where Japanese people
were) viewed as the enemy--even Japanese Americans, viewed as the enemy, because
they were put in the (relocation) camps.
So Im wondering: you come as a Japanese
person and woman.
Do you, how do you ... when you reflect back, look back--cause
lot of times you dont recognize it when its happening--do you feel that that worked
against you?
Obviously, in some ways, it worked in your favor, like you said you got the
scholarship from Berklee cause they could advertise, they used you for advertising.
Do
you feel that these, that you being a woman and Japanese worked against you in
America, whether its just being a jazz musician, or just the way you were treated
socially?

1652
Akiyoshi:
1653
 I think, uh, you know, I never thought about it til, uh, this woman issue came
out--I think it was (Germaine) Greer or someone like that from, uh, England--that
started this feminist blah, blah, blah.
I never really thought about being Japanese as ... a
handicap or as a ... so on, til ... there was a newspaper in Boston.
I was getting a lot of
attention: I was getting a Mademoiselle award (in January 1958) or things like that, or
became an ASCAP member.
And uh, the journalist who was writing, he wrote--I dont
quite remember the exact words of that one--but basically what he was saying was,
Why is she getting all this attention?
A lot of good Bostonian jazz players, theyre not
getting any limelight," or things like that.
So, I thought about, well, we have a saying, it
says: "stick out nail will be beaten" (laughs), so I guess thats what it is!
You know, and
track begins in mid-sentence) it was a big band.
It was just the first time when ...
I think


was seventy-, say sixty--I think it was 74, uh, September.
Thats what I think.
It was a
Friday night and there was a lot of attention.
And it was some paper--Im not quite sure,
I dont remember which paper, San Francisco or Los Angeles paper--but the paper, it
said, "I question her authenticity.
" That was, that was ... so, there were things like that:
its obviously because shes Japanese," you know, "its not authentic.
" But thats why,
when in 2007 I received the NEA Jazz Master and you have to make a little speech, and I
mentioned the fact that I came a long way from being written ... about "question her
authenticity," to what is the highest honor of a jazz player.
Because I think sometimes it
gets that kind of things because its ... we also have a saying: "a little bump above the
eyes can annoy" (laughs).
So it, like, annoys some people to get (??).
But if youre a
pioneer--I guess I am a pioneer, I think....

1654
Brown:
1655
 Mm-hmm!

1656
Akiyoshi:
1657
 ...you get all the heat.
But that comes with it, so you have to accept, you
know, everything.
Thats the way I think.
I was ... there was a lot of those ...
I decided
to have a very simple rule that I decided to have for myself.
It is, one, if I have no control
over what somebody else will say something, or like, say "Oh, shes Japanese," or Im
Japanese, I have no control (over that), Im a woman, Im a jazz musician, you know.
But I wont worry about it if I have no control.
But if I have control over (it), and then if
its, I dont like it, I correct (it).
You know, those two things.
So, if I have no control
over (it), I decided not to worry about (it).
But at the same time, that sounds so
wonderful and easy (laughs).

1658
Brown:
1659
 (Laughs) Well, there is ... (laughs harder) ... well, theres always, since we are
in America, and we are dealing with music, theres always the business side of things.
And that ... and during the course of this interview, youve talked about the challenges of
dealing with the business of this music.
And nowadays, were in the midst of this huge
change from the analog to digital and the internet, and many of the landmark recordings
youve produced are no longer available, or at least conspicuous in the marketplace.
So
obviously the business is something youve had to negotiate.
How do you feel--do you
feel you were successful in dealing the business, and if not, what would you change?

1660
Akiyoshi:
1661
 I dont do that.
I dont do that, because Im not capable.
So I just, uh, if
anybody were interested, they probably will offer something.
It its not, thats the way it
is.
I can only do what I can do, which is to try to do my best to write music or play better
than yesterday.
It may not be always that way, but at least I can try, you know.
Thats all
I can do.
And that gives me full time, you know, every day.
Its full time for me, so....

1662
Brown:
1663
 So once you become--this is what I learned from Red Callender--if you
become a musician, he said, youre al--... you know Red Callender, right?
Thats
Charles Mingus teacher, so uh....



1664
Akiyoshi:
1665
 What?

1666
Brown:
1667
 Charles Mingus teacher.
He said, "If you become a musician," he said, talking
to me, "you will always be a student.
You will never be a master.
" You believe this?

1668
Akiyoshi:
1669
 Oh yes.
Yes.
I think you try.
All you can do is try.
Because there are always
.. if you did something that you really wanted to correct, or achieve something, as soon
as you achieve that, theres another one in front of you.
Never, you know, um, fortunate.
But I think thats good.
Its ...
I feel sometimes fortunate that way that Im a musician,
because theres always something to do.

1670
Brown:
1671
 Well, Toshiko, during the course of this interview youve talked about this
career, this amazing career of yours.
Youre, you know--as you say yourself--a pioneer.
You had overcome so many things, whether its cultural, whether its musical, or
whatever, um, but yet youve succeeded, you know.

1672
Akiyoshi:
1673
 (Laughs modestly)

1674
Brown:
1675
 And the way to measure that is your own, what you feel is your own success.
And also you have been recognized: the Nanri award, you said, was the first award, and
when you had your big band in Los Angeles, you got many Grammy nominations....

1676
Akiyoshi:
1677
 (Laughs modestly)

1678
Brown:
1679
 ...so what were the other awards that meant something to you?

1680
Akiyoshi:
1681
 I think it probably meant something ... all awards mean something, because,
as you know, music is not a sport: theres no such thing as number one or number two.
But when you have an award or you have certain things, its because they are paying
attention to what you do.
At the same time, if they dont like you, theyre not going to
vote for you.
So theres some love involved; so you are loved by many people, so on,
and you are pay ... people pay attention to your ... what you do.
That's where the value
lies.
So I have ... all awards mean a lot.
But, I must say, for me, its the Master, Jazz
Master, because that comes from America, which is ... Im not an American citizen, and,
as I said, it came a long time, a long way from being written "not authentic" or what have
you (laughs).
So (for) jazz musicians, its an achievement getting National Endowment
for the) Arts to ... by recognize and given a fellowship, Jazz Master Fellowship, I think
thats about the highest I can ... you know.
I really, uh, when that phone rang--it usually
comes earlier and they say that you shouldnt talk til the official announcement and so
on--but when they said it, I thought, "Is this confirmed?
" First of all I said, "Is it
confirmed?
" and she said, "Yes, its (confirmed), congratulations," and blah, blah, blah.

And then, because ...
I have a ... Lew always said--and often I mentioned at the
Birdland, you know, thing--Lew always said I am "demographically challenged"
laughs).

1682
Brown:
1683
 (Laughs)

1684
Akiyoshi:
1685
 So I didnt really think I could get things like that, so ...
I think thats about
the highest, you know.
Im very, very grateful.
I think thats ...
I have to be, I dont
know if I am worthy.
I have to ...
I can try (laughs).

1686
Brown:
1687
 (Laughs) Well, I think, because you received the award, the jazz world knows
that youre worthy.
And so, Toshiko--unless you have anything else you want to add to
this interview--I just want to say, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award, just want to thank you so much for
allowing us to come into your house to document your life for the historical record.
Um,
we hope that this will be shared with many future generations to come, so they
understand that a woman from Japan can come to America and become a master of

Transcribers note: Ms. Akiyoshi was interviewed in her second (or, really, third)
language, English.
In the interview she usually uses present-tense verbs in talking about
past events.
However, to avoid confusion and enhance readability, when appropriate I
have transcribed her verbs in the past tense.
I do this out of utmost respect for Ms.
Akiyoshis fluency and expressiveness, so as to draw attention to the content of her
narrative, and not to allow negligible grammatical idiosyncrasies to distract the reader.
Whenever possible, I have inserted in brackets ( ) short annotations and supplemental
information from Ms. Akiyoshis 1996 Japanese autobiography and my own research.

 Today is June 29th, 2008, and this is the oral history interview conducted with
Toshiko Akiyoshi in her house on 38 W. 94th Street in Manhattan, New York.
Good
afternoon, Toshiko-san!

2
Akiyoshi:
3
 Good afternoon!

4
Brown:
5
 At long last, Im so honored to be able to conduct this oral history interview with
you.
Its been about ten years since we last saw each other--we had a chance to talk at
the Monterey Jazz Festival--but this interview we want you to tell your life history, so
we want to start at the very beginning, starting (with) as much information as you can tell
us about your family.
First, if you can give us your birth name, your complete birth
name.

6
Akiyoshi:
7
 To-shi-ko.

8
Brown:
9
 Akiyoshi.

10
Akiyoshi:
11
 Just the way you pronounced.

12
Brown:
13
 Oh, okay (laughs).
So, Toshiko Akiyoshi.


14
Akiyoshi:
15
 Yes.

16
Brown:
17
 And does "Toshiko" mean anything special in Japanese?

18
Akiyoshi:
19
 Well, I think,...all names, as you know, Japanese names depends on the kanji
Chinese ideographs).
Different kanji means different (things), pronounce it the same
way.
And mine is "Toshiko," (which means) something like "sensitive," "susceptible,"
something to do with a dark sort of nature.
Most womens "Toshiko" is usually more
elegant, more woman-like, kinda, that kanji they usually use.
Mine isnt.
Whatever.
(laughs)

20
Brown:
21
 (Laughs) Okay.
Can you tell us your parents, both your names of your parents?
And where theyre originally from.

22
Akiyoshi:
23
 My fathers name is Katsur Akiyoshi.
My mothers maiden name is Hiraike,
so her name is Shigeko Hiraike.
And they were married, I dont know when, wherever,
laughs) and when I was born, Im the last of the four daughters.
Four daughters.

24
Akiyoshi:
25
 And, uh, my father had a job in old Manchuria, today its called Liaoning
province of China, in (a) Japanese cotton, textile, company.
And the time when I was in
sixth grade, my father became independent and he started his own company, more like a
trading company.

26
Brown:
27
 Can you tell me where your parents are from in Japan, before they migrated to
Manchuria?

28
Akiyoshi:
29
 Oh, they were both from Kysh, ita....

30
Brown:
31
 ita?

32
Akiyoshi:
33
 ...province.
And, uh ...
I dont know much about (it) except that.
(laughs)

34
Brown:
35
 (Chuckles).
Okay.
And can you give us your birth date?

36
Akiyoshi:
37
 First part?

38
Brown:
39
 Your birth date?

40
Akiyoshi:
41
 I was born in 1929, December 12th.


42
Brown:
43
 Twelfth.

44
Akiyoshi:
45
 Twelfth.
Twelve-twelve, very easy to remember.

46
Brown:
47
 Right.
And you were born, do you know exactly where in Manchuria?
I know
Dairen (Ch: Dalian) is whats recorded....

48
Akiyoshi:
49
 I was educated there, but I was born in a place called Ryy, Liaoyang--I
guess they maybe pronounce the Chinese way, probably called Liaoyang--where the big
Japanese cotton textile company was.
So....

50
Brown:
51
 So when you were living in China, um, Manchuria, or Dairen, did you live with
your sisters, so everyone grew up, you had the whole family there?

52
Akiyoshi:
53
 Well, whole family ... Liaoyang city, it didnt have high school, so all my
sisters, they, when they came to graduate (from) grammar school, they all went to Dairen,
where (there was) a junior high, high school.
So, thats what my mother wanted.
Most
children, I think, in Ryy went to the city called Anzan (Ch: nshn), which is about an
hour, not even quite (an) hour, maybe 40 minutes train ride, the next big city from
Ryy.
But my mother wanted them to be educated in Dairen, I guess its considered a
better school for their....

54
Brown:
55
 Now, was this a Japanese school...?

56
Akiyoshi:
57
 Yes.

58
Brown:
59
 ...and was there a large Japanese community?

60
Akiyoshi:
61
 They were all Japanese schools.
(Its) amazing the fact, you know, Im
thinking about when I went to high school in Dairen, there was ... in those days, (it was)
like a man and a woman (were) different; boys had a boys high school, girls had a girls
high school.
And the girl high school alone, (Dairen) had five of them.
And each school,
I would say, when I was in high school, classes were about 45 students.
And we had five
class(es), I mean five different, you know, classmates, like, say, Cherries class, and there
was an ume (plum) club, there was like a chrysanthemum class, things like that.

62
Brown:
63
 Based after, uh, flower names.

64
Akiyoshi:
65
 Yeah, so basically, youre looking at it, girls alone (were) approximately 240
students in one class, one, yeah, one, what do you call...and we had a high school that
takes four years.
So if you multiply that, basically you have about, a little over one
thousand children.
Now, this is only girls alone.
So, lets say the boys are approximately


the same number, maybe more or less.
So from that you kind of estimate how many
Japanese were in Dairen, you can imagine how big the population was.

66
Brown:
67
 And all instruction was in Japanese?

68
Akiyoshi:
69
 There was ...
I dont remember having a Chinese student.
I think if they
spoke Japanese, there probably could have been.
But obviously there werent (any).
So
without my knowing it, they were, like, separated.
You know, (in) much later years,
much later, I dont quite remember, it was over ten years ago, I was asked by NHK
television, which is like the BBC, to go back to where I was born and raised, they called
it) Trip to Where the Heart Belongs (Sekai waga kokoro no tabi, broadcast Oct. 17,
, something like that.
And it was a new television series, and I was the first one.
And I hadnt been there in fifty years at that time.
And that time I realized the fact that is,
we were segregated (from Chinese).
You know, I never thought about it that way.
And,
when I went there--see, you cant do this without having a Chinese part of cooperation,
and they had people who spoke Japanese fluently, and they are the ones who set up a
tour--and from morning til evening we had Chinese food.
And it tasted very, very
good, but there wasnt anything like a, no ocean fish, except with the governors official
dinner, or mayors official dinner.
Other than that, fish, every once and a while that
would be the river fish, freshwater fish.
And I realized that we were considered,
probably, a privileged class, and I thought they were probably looking at us like that.
I
didnt realize til then that Japan is ... one of the things that I was thinking about,
sometimes compared to, lets say, this country had a long history of prejudice to(ward)
anybody who had color, you know, the black people, or the yellow, whatever.
And the
old days, as you know, America had segregation, you cant ride on the same bus, what
have you.
But one thing about Manchuria, now China, their railroad was built by a
Japanese railroad company (South Manchurian Railway), but they were more advanced
than in Japan: the rails were wider, and also it didnt matter if they were Chinese or
American or Japanese--I guess there werent any Americans there, I dont know
laughs).
Maybe there were some, priests maybe.
But, if you had the money, you could
ride first class, second class, (??
) class, you know.
So there was no--as far as that is
concerned--there was no segregation as far as that is concerned.
I think thats, you
know, something.
I never sort of ... also, we were, it was mandatory to learn Chinese,
from the third grade.
Boy, its a hard language, Chinese!
(chuckles).

70
Brown:
71
 Do you remember any Chinese?

72
Akiyoshi:
73
 Oh yes, yes, but Ill tell you one thing: if I stayed in China for, maybe, one
month, without talking Japanese, you know, I think Id get (it) back.
I think I ... because
all together, three, four, five, six, then it was junior high, one, two, ... seven years of
Chinese.
When I was third year of high school that the war was going pretty bad, so in
fourth grade the war was ended.


74
Brown:
75
 When did you learn English?
Did you study English in school?

76
Akiyoshi:
77
 English was from high school, the very beginning of high school, and, uh, the
war started when I was (in) sixth grade, and about a year later, no, maybe two years later,
English was taken off from a mandatory class, and it was you could attend the class as a,
if you wanted.
So, it wasnt like a regular class, but you could apply for (it).
Which I
did, but I did terrible, I mean I was just....
Language wasnt (laughs) my forte.

78
Brown:
79
 So when you learned Chinese, of course, kanji is the big difference, and learning
all the kanji, so....

80
Akiyoshi:
81
 Kanji, yes, kanji, some (of them) mean the same, because, after all, it came
from China.
But most of them are different.
Some are the same meaning.
But it is a
really hard language, the pronunciation is hard (chuckles).

82
Brown:
83
 Tonal, as well.

84
Akiyoshi:
85
 Yeah, thats what I mean.
Its the same thing, but it depends on the tone ...

86
Brown:
87
 "N ho ma.
"

88
Akiyoshi:
89
 ... yeah, different meaning.
So its a very hard....

90
Brown:
91
 So you were talking earlier about the difference in the social strata.
So, you
were considered, your upbringing, your social class while you were in Manchuria, you
were very comfortable?
Youd only....

92
Akiyoshi:
93
 Yes, I really, I dont think I was the only one, but when I was in childhood, I
never even thought about things like that.
I was a very, maybe simple-minded.
When I
was in first grade a third-grade child played the Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Turkish March and I liked to play
just like that, thats how I started playing piano, studying piano.
And, uh, always been, if
I listened to my parents at home, if I listened to my teachers at school, Im okay, stay out
of trouble.
So I never really thought about anything.

94
Brown:
95
 So you just recounted your earliest inspiration about piano, you said you heard
another student playing the Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Turkish March, so, Rondo Alla Turca (scats a melodic
phrase, last movement of Piano Sonata No.
11 in A Major).

96
Akiyoshi:
97
 Right.

98
Brown:
99
 So this was your first recollection of your interest in music....



100
Akiyoshi:
101
 Yes, piano, yes.

102
Brown:
103
 So ... a classmate?
You say another student played this?

104
Akiyoshi:
105
 Yes, no, no, she was in third grade, I was in first grade.
So, thats when I
started, I wanted to play, so started when I was in first grade, started taking lessons.

106
Brown:
107
 Was this unusual?
Did any of your older sisters have piano lessons, or were
musical?

108
Akiyoshi:
109
 Well (sighs), Im not quite sure.
The only thing, we didnt have piano teacher-
teachers.
I had to learn from, uh, there was a music class teacher (who) was the piano
teacher.
Im not quite sure how great they were, you know, at that particular point, but
Id go twice a week to his home to study.
I still remember it was an upright piano, and I
had to go from where I lived, my family lived, to the teachers house, youd have to walk
for half an hour, to get to the place, you know.
And it was very ... when I think about it
now, I think in many ways, today people would consider, "Boy, that was a hard life," or
something, because everyday youd have to get to school, walk about half an hour, takes
half an hour to get to school, and same thing coming back.
So, uh, I think it is an
American standard, if youre that far, you have a school bus, you know, (we) didnt have
anything like that.
But, this may not be appropriate time or anything, but when my
daughter started going to school here, I realized that I had a much better education than
my daughter.
And ... it was nineteen-sixty .... my daughter was going to PS-41 and it
was sixty-, lemme see, I dont quite remember, it was mid-sixties, I think.
But anyway,
she came back and she said, "Well, (there is) no more music class, because the budget
was cut.
" Now, (she said) the next time, "Oh, no more, uh, what do you call, tais
calisthenics), physical fitness education because of budget cuts.
" And I thought, "What
a strange place that this could be," because when I went to school in Manchuria, Im sure
everybody agrees, Japan was a poor country.
I can tell by looking at old film how life
was very humble and poor, I can tell by films when I see it.
But the whole attitude or
philosophy is like, children must be educated, must be educated, like to be educated,
therefore, budget must be spared.
And, vice versa here.
And, I dont know about today,
but when my daughter went to grammar school, America was the richest country, you
know, I dont think as much debt as today (laughs), deficit as today.
And I thought it was
a very strange country, somehow the priorities were upside down.
So thats what I
remember, so I think I had a very good education, and music education, as well.

110
Brown:
111
 Were all your teachers Japanese?
Do you remember?

112
Akiyoshi:
113
 Oh yes, they were all Japanese, except when I started high school and I started
taking lessons from a pia-... there was a music school there, and then I would go there to


study with, this piano teachers name was Yang (Xiaoyi)-sensei.
We called (him) Y-
sensei, and it was a Chinese person.
Um, miraculously, actually, when I went back to
Manchuria, old Manchuria, for the television, they found him, he was over 80 years old,
and ... Yang-sensei.
And I asked him, "Why (do) you speak Japanese so well?
" He said,
Oh, I went to, I was educated in Japan, Japanese music academy, he went.
It was
Musashino Music School.
And, uh, of course he was two years (in the) Cultural
Revolution, and he was sent to a farm, and he couldnt talk about the music and so on and
so forth, nearly thirty years.
And he was actually permitted to come back and teach, but
that was ....
So he was my teacher, he was a Chinese man, and I still remember, we had
in high school, we had one of our classes was the sewing class, had to sew.
And the high
school had a pool, and I stung my finger with a needle and I went swimming so it kind of
became infected, so I couldnt really play the piano, so I just went--I never missed a
lesson, never, in all that time, Im proud to say--so I went there and I showed Y-sensei
and said, "I cant play because I ...." So he really got mad at me, he said, "Youre a
pianist," you know, "you shouldnt do some stupid things like that," or something like
that.
He got terribly upset and mad at me.

114
Brown:
115
 How old were you?
(chuckles)

116
Akiyoshi:
117
 I was probably about ... fourteen?
Or maybe thirteen and a half?

118
Brown:
119
 So youd been studying for a while by then, six or seven years.

120
Akiyoshi:
121
 Yes, yes.

122
Brown:
123
 Okay.
Um, I asked earlier about your older sisters.
Could you tell me their
names, and if they had any musical training?

124
Akiyoshi:
125
 Who?

126
Brown:
127
 Your older sisters?

128
Akiyoshi:
129
 My oldest sisters name is Hisako (spells it).
The second sisters name is
Miyoko, who is alive and well, we are very close.
And the third sister, it was interesting:
my father, like any other Japanese father, uh, man, they always wanted to have a boy.
So
they got a girl, the next one was a girl, then the third one was also a girl, so he was
hoping, he said, "Well, this will be the zero for the girl," so he named her Reiko.
Rei is
like another word of saying "zero.
" So, then here came (chuckles), here I come
chuckles), so he just named me Toshiko, because thats probably a normal name
laughs).

130
Brown:
131
 Any of them musically inclined, or were either of your parents musically


inclined?

132
Akiyoshi:
133
 No, actually, Im the only one, but my older sister always liked opera, and my
second sister is a quite accomplished Japanese traditional dancer.
My immediate sister
doesnt really have any interest in it.
My mother was interested in music, but she wasnt
very, lets say, she wasnt talented enough.
My father was a student, he was very,
extremely interested in n, N-O-H, you know, mens ....

134
Brown:
135
 N drama?

136
Akiyoshi:
137
 Yes, he studied for quite (a) long time and he actually had a diploma to be, to
be able to teach others.
So he was n singing and dance, but no one was ... my case was
the piano, but the music, you know, was ....

138
Brown:
139
 But it was more Japanese traditional music, not Western or ... well, you said
your sister liked opera ... but the training of everybody was more traditional....

140
Akiyoshi:
141
 No, it isnt.
Because Japanese school, the music class, is all Western.
I
remember when (we were) in grammar school, there was "Home on the Range" (laughs),
things like that were in the book.
And everything was European, Western.
If you were
interested in learning some Japanese music or dancing, you had to do outside-of-school
activity, which my second sister did.

142
Brown:
143
 What kind of music did you hear around the house?
Was music played,
recordings, radio, or maybe outside, down in the streets?
Do you have any memories?

144
Akiyoshi:
145
 Well, when I started to play, started piano, I dont really think much ....
Actually, we had, I think, a gramophone, you had to do by your hands, kind of thing.
And my mother liked it, like Deanna Durbin (laughs).
I remember, (when I was)
seventeen, eighteen, it had, the label part (of the record) had her picture.
And I think it
was probably the Traviata (sings).
I think thats what it was.
Something like that.
But
other than that, I didnt really hear, except my, as I said, my older sister loved opera.
So
when, when I was in the fourth grade, my sister was already in high school way up
there..., no, graduated high school, actually.
And ... Ryy is a very historical city for
Chinese history, I think, because it had a walled city.
But they didnt really have
anything, there was a ... today it is the capital of Liaoning province, its called Shnyang,
Mukden in Manchu), those days it was called Hten (in Japanese).
That was a big city.
And there was a Japanese opera company, called (after founder and tenor) Fujiwara
Yoshie, Fujiwara Opera Company, (that) came there, and my sister wanted to see it.
And, oh, that took ... my mother was traveling, I think she visited her relatives in Japan,
so (she) wasnt there.
My father had to ask to my school to get me off early because (so)
I could take the train.
It took a couple of hours to get there.
And there was ... that was


La Traviata.
I still kind of, sort of remember seeing (it).
Anyway, maybe because of that
I dont like opera (laughs).

146
Brown:
147
 (laughs).
Okay.
So, um, while you were studying piano, did you have any
preferences as far as the repertoire?
Did you like Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Chopin?
Did you like
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven?

148
Akiyoshi:
149
 No, first, (I) started like everybody else.
You start from (Gabriel) Baille and
Carl) Czerny 30 (New Studies in Technique), 40 (Daily Exercises).
About 40, then you
went to other things, then the same time you do (a) sonatina.
By the time it was Yang-
sensei it was sonatas.
But, like every other, studying piano, there was a normal
procedure.
Its not like today, people do some other different ways.
So that was the way
it was.
I didnt really have any preference or anything.
But when I went to high school,
as I said, going to the sonatas, obviously it was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_12">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span> and Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven, and, uh, I was
very much into Beethoven.
I was really ... and then I remember in high school and I
saw, those days it was 78 (RPM records), so its like if you have like a concerto or
something it doesnt go on one (record), so you have to have one or two or three or
something like that (chuckles).
And I still remember Rudolf Serkin Apassionata
Sonata (Piano Sonata No.
23, recorded 1938), and I listened and--ooh, ahh--I really
kind of admired (it), and I was thinking, well, someday maybe Id like to visit Germany.
Things like that.

150
Brown:
151
 So it was Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens music?
Was it the particular way of playing it?
Or just
the sound or both?

152
Akiyoshi:
153
 No, I think it was Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens music.
His music was ... its not quite ... you
know, I dont think (at) that particular time I didnt think anything the way Im analyzing
today.
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens music is more ... (to) some degree, I think--this is probably a far-
out analysis--but <span class="fullMatch" id="match_18">John Coltrane</span>, like, compared to <span class="fullMatch" id="match_17">Sonny Rollins</span> ... Sonny Rollins, if it was
everyone like that, you might as well forget about it, or something.
Certain things,
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven had certain things, more, try harder kind of things.
Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, on the other hand,
is very natural and sounds always like angels or whatever it is, or, sounds more natural,
and it wasnt interesting to me.
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven was the one I kind of identified myself with.
So I think everybody is different, but it was just, thats what I kind of, I think, identify,
you know.

154
Brown:
155
 Did you finish high school before your family emigrated to Japan?

156
Akiyoshi:
157
 No.
No.
Before I finished high school (the) war was ended.
So I was an
honorary graduate," just like anybody else in my class.
So, thats the year I was
supposed to graduate, the following year in March.
Here, everything (begins) is
September, but in Japan it was March, the (school year) starts from April.
So the war


ended in August, so there were a few more months to go, which we all did not go, we just
graduated "honorary" (chuckles).

158
Brown:
159
 So when the war started, do you remember, did it impact your life, or,
economically or consciously?

160
Akiyoshi:
161
 Oh yes, of course (sighs).
You know, one of the things about that ...
I have
been ...
I wasnt going to school in Japan, so I have no experience of air raid, I have no
experience of severe conditions, because Manchuria was still ... and also something to do
with my fathers business, I dont remember having a problem with a shortage of food or
things like that.
So actually I didnt really start thinking til I was third year in high
school, there was....
Either you started going to a factory to sew military clothes, or also,
if you wanted to become a nurse.
And I thought, well, in the war if I can do something, I
should become a nurse, and I volunteered to become a nurse.
And I went to my mother
and I said my father said it was okay, and I went to my father (laughs) and I said my
mother said it was okay, because my fathers business was in Ryy, so still he
periodically visited, but I was in a school in Dairen, and at that time, because Im
probably the youngest, my mother came with me to live.
So (the family) was kind of,
sort of separated, in a sense.
So I told both, "He said okay, she said okay" (chuckles).

162
Brown:
163
 (laughs)

164
Akiyoshi:
165
 So I went and I had training for four months, and (after) four months training
was going to be finished, thats when the war was ended (laughs).

166
Brown:
167
 So then what happened.

168
Akiyoshi:
169
 Then, after that it was very difficult.
Uh, what I understand is this may not be
all the gossip, it could be very true.
Because when you start thinking about how the
Japanese military runs, what I understand was the ones who decided, they had a meeting,
they thought maybe ... you know, we were about fifteen and a half years old, all (of) us,
to give them (students) poison, instead of them becoming prisoners of war or something,
thats what I understand.
That was actually, even that came up at the meeting.
So Im
very happy to know that they decided to try to send them back to their parents.
That was
a very hard trip when I think about it, because you had to go under the..., at that time,
Russia was already into the war and Russians were already into Manchuria.
So, under
the hiding from them, you had to go to certain points, you stay in ground....

170
Brown:
171
 Underground.

172
Akiyoshi:
173
 Not underground, a tent, you know what I mean.
Id never done that before
laughs).
So that was kind of a hard trip.
One time we were on the train and the Russian


soldiers came through, and everybody, we all cut our hair very, very short, and it was ...
we had one those uniforms, and it was dark so there wasnt anything (that) happened or
anything.
That was also kind of (a) not pleasant experience.
Anyway, that was hard and
it was ... think about ... the place where we were trained, it is on the map, it was close to
China.
When youre looking at Manchuria and China, the land is the same, except its
separated by a border, whatever it is.
And Dairen, it is close to China, and Ryy is in
the middle, kind of the middle of Manchuria.
Sort of north in the middle, northeast, little
bit east, in the middle.
And where we were trained, it was close to Dairen, it was west of
Dairen.
The way they came is, they go ...
I was the first one, I left ... they stopped (in)
Ryy, and I stopped, and everybody thought I shouldnt go home, but I did.
Which
means ... logically speaking, Dairen would be the first, because it was closer, than to go
to Ryy, if they were, you know....
But they went around (Dairen), meaning they
probably had to go that way to hide from the so-called enemy.
It took a long time, I think
that was a hard trip.
And when I got off the train and I walked to my home and I got to
my home, there were Russian soldiers (who) were taking all (of our) things from (the)
house (chuckles).
And our house was in front of a park, you know, and in the park, (there
were) all these Chinese merchants waiting (chuckles).
And they go there and they were
selling (our things), of course, the Russians, and theyd come back and get more
chuckles), take something away.
I was....

174
Brown:
175
 So your family wasnt in the house?

176
Akiyoshi:
177
 Of course they were.

178
Brown:
179
 But everybody was still taking out the belongings?

180
Akiyoshi:
181
 Of course.

182
Brown:
183
 While they were there?

184
Akiyoshi:
185
 They were soldiers, you know.
And, uh, so I just came home (in) the middle
of all this.
My father he was like really, I think he was probably frightened, "Oh my
God!
" (chuckles).
So that was.... And the next day, he had arranged so that there would
be an underground, you know, you can go to a.... You know Japanese have tatami
bamboo woven floor mats), and under tatami was the floor, and under the floor was a
little room for ... just a little bit of room so we could just hide there.

186
Brown:
187
 So you were hiding underneath the tatami, underneath the floor.
You were
hiding from the soldiers because you were afraid that they would...?

188
Akiyoshi:
189
 Thats right, because they came, but you never know.
They basically came to
get the stuff, but sometimes they were not....
So, you know....



190
Brown:
191
 So after they ransacked your house, then what happened with your family?

192
Akiyoshi:
193
 Oh, just, we were fine, I was the only one who wasnt together (with them),
except my oldest sister was married to a military man, so they were in China, they
werent there.
Um ... this was, as I said, it was 1946, uh...1945, excuse me, summer,
and til 1946 we were permitted, we left there, the first time it was occupied by Russians,
then there was the Chinese communist army, and at that time they occupied ... a
lieutenant--actually his wife was also a lieutenant--they occupied our houses upstairs.
And then after that, it was the (Chinese) Nationalist Army, Chiang Kai-sheks army, and
they occupied the upstairs, too.
The time we were leaving, they were getting, you know,
more communists were coming in, but thats when we left.
But it took, uh, it was almost
a year.
But, I think we were earlier than the people in Dairen.

194
Brown:
195
 So what happened to your fathers business?

196
Akiyoshi:
197
 Well, what happened?
(laughs) I mean, we couldnt have anything....
Everyone who went back to Japan from any(where) abroad--not just China, Im sure
there were other places--they could only bring what you could carry.
No jewels.
And
also, there was a ... (the) yen changed to new (currency), so all the money, it didnt mean
anything, and it was a ...
I remember it was one person, 1000 per person, was given by
the) government when you got into Japan.
So we were four children with parents, so I
think it was 6000 was given from the government.
I remember getting into ... its near
Hiroshima, a place called Ujina, you know, port, and you got in there and you got DDT
on the top of your hair, bong (laughing)!

198
Brown:
199
 Really?

200
Akiyoshi:
201
 Yeah, yeah (laughs).

202
Brown:
203
 So as (laughs) soon as you got to the port, they disinfect(ed) everybody like that?

204
Akiyoshi:
205
 Well, I think it was because everybody was coming back from wherever it
was, theyre probably, maybe carry(ing) something.
American soldiers, we all got
powder, white powder, DDT, pshoo, pshoo (laughs).

206
Brown:
207
 Oh, from American soldiers.

208
Akiyoshi:
209
 Of course, from (the) American side, you know (chuckles).

210
Brown:
211
 So what was your first impression when you got back to Japan?
(Was) this your
first time in Japan, then?


212
Akiyoshi:
213
 No, I had been several times with my mother, because my mother often
visited, and because I was the youngest, so she always took me along, so many times.
But (sighs), first, I tell you, first my impression from Ujina port back to where my parents
came from--we settled in Beppu city--and the train, to me the train looked like a real toy
train, because I think I mentioned earlier, the train in Manchuria was wider, railroad was
wider, and a much better train, and in Japan it was still kind of narrow.
Even today if you
go to some parts, northern parts or someplace, also Hokkaid railroad, its still old,
narrow.
So first my impression was, "What a small train!
" (chuckles).

214
Brown:
215
 So youre sixteen years old, youve already (laughs) got training as a nurse, a
volunteer nurse, you have piano lessons.
Do you have an idea of what life, or what you
want to do for a career?

216
Akiyoshi:
217
 No, actually, my parents wanted me to go to medical school.
But we got back
to Japan in July--I dont quite remember, fourteenth or fifteenth, I think, middle of July
anyway--and I mentioned earlier that the Japanese school starts (in the) spring, so I had a
few months.
And meanwhile, (in) Beppu I saw this dance hall, they had a flier pasted on
the window saying "Pianist wanted.
" So I went in because ...
I knew my parents no
longer could furnish me with a piano, it was that kind of condition.
They didnt even
have a place to live of their own for the time being.
So, uh, I went in and I was hired like
immediately because.... See, Beppu city, it is a very small city, I dont know if you
know), Im sure you do, its a hot spring (resort).
So there was a small (U.S. military)
camp, meaning there were many dance halls for Americans.
And, as you know,
Americans could not come to Japanese (places), Japanese could not go to Americans.
So Japanese wanted to dance, too, so there were Japanese dance halls, a few of them.
There werent that many musicians living in Beppu.
So I said, "I play piano," and I was
hired just like that (chuckles).

218
Brown:
219
 And Beppu is B-E-P-P-U?

220
Akiyoshi:
221
 Yes.

222
Brown:
223
 So, uh, what kind of band, what was the instrumentation for this band?

224
Akiyoshi:
225
 Its leader was a violin player.
I suspect he probably was, used to be (in) the
navy band.
He was an elderly person, everybody else was younger.
And it was violin,
accordion, drums, alto saxophone, piano.
Thats it.

226
Brown:
227
 All Japanese musicians?

228
Akiyoshi:
229
 Of course.
And there was a Hit Kit ... you remember Hit Kit?
I dont know.

Army Navy) Hit Kit (of Popular Songs) is one of the things that the servicemen ... every
month or maybe twice a month, Im not quite sure, it was American hit songs.
It was for
the American servicemen.
And you could get them, I think they had all those, you know,
Five Minutes More," or like "Shoo Fly Pie," what have you (laughs), things like that.
It
was lead sheets, thats what they played.
I didnt know any chord symbols, Id never
seen (those) in my life.
So I said, "Whats this?
" So the violin player said, "Oh she
doesnt know anything!
" And, uh, "Can you play piano?
" So I played Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens
Sonata No.
3 (sings), and he said, "Oh, she can play piano!
" (laughs) So that was the
beginning.
And, uh, I was hired for the dance hall for Japanese.
I think that was
probably a good... it was lucky, because a Japanese record collector....
When jazz was
exported to other countries--I dont know about Europe, but exported to Japan--they
mostly appealed to the upper-middle-class young people.
So they had, some of them had
collected records.
And this person was Mister Fukui.
Hes still alive and well, I hope.
I
saw him three years ago.
But ... he was one of the collectors.
And he noticed my
playing, so he invited me over to his home, and he played Teddy Wilson "Sweet
Lorraine"--this became a very famous story.
But when I heard him playing it, I said, "I
want to play just like that!
" So that was my first introduction to jazz.
And I think it was
lucky the fact that he played Teddy Wilson, because as you know Teddy Wilson played
such a clean, beautiful--actually swing-style pianists all played very clean--but his in
particular, he had a technique, and his own runs were like the same string of pearls, you
know, like beautifully played, and it was not like today, in the old days people didnt use
the pedal, so they all came out so nice and clean.
And that was really good, I think, it
appealed to me a lot.
So after that I tried to listen to records --he had a couple of
different records--and about eight months later, I was hired in Fukuoka city.
So I moved
to Fukuoka city.
I was seventeen years old, I think, seventeen years old.
My parents
were like (groans).
But one thing about ... when Japan lost the war, there was a certain
structure that was broken, in other words, the family, the structure had always been the
father was the beginning, was at the middle, and hes the big pole; the mother (was) the
support, the parents, and the children were supposed to listen to the parents, like that.
When the war was ended my father, for a while he didnt know what (had) come over,
what hit him, because it wasnt his fault that he lost everything, and he hadnt even
foreseen, the Japanese never thought they were going to lose a war.
So, they lost it, he
lost everything, and he really didnt know what to do.
And that affected the children.
I
was at that time fifteen years old, and it just affected.... And when we went back to
Japan that was already broken, the way my father had to try to find a place for us to live,
too, and so on, and meanwhile I took a job in a dance hall, and that was, like, unthinkable
for ... my father got really mad.
But, uh (chuckles), because the normal situation in
Japan in those days, the girls never worked, they dont work til they go to ... then they
married.
Its not ... if youre in the middle class, the girls are not supposed to work.
So,
its a special dance hall, my God, you know, evil place (laughs).

230
Brown:
231
 (laughs) What else, what ... you mentioned a few titles, but what was the


repertoire?
I mean, what was the repertoire you were playing, so this gives an idea of
what kind of dancing was going on?

232
Akiyoshi:
233
 Well, I dont quite remember everything.
As I said, I remember "Sweet Sue,"
you know, "Shoo Fly Pie," or "Five Minutes More," I remember those.
"Home on the
Range" was there, too.
Things like that.
I dont remember til later on when I was hired
and then moved to Fukuoka, and I was hired by a big band.
This was the first big band
excitedly), and it was Ryutaro Yamada and his band, his orchestra.

234
Brown:
235
 Say it again?
What was his name?

236
Akiyoshi:
237
 Ryutaro Yamada, yes.
He was an old musician, played trumpet and piano, I
understand.
But (at) the officers club, you kind of had to, somebody had to stand in the
front to wave his arms (conduct), so he had to do that, so he needed a pianist.
So I was
the one.
And this was really great, because the officers club had a--we call (it)
denchiku, you know what I mean?--like a gramophone, you had to do by hand, but this
was, because it was plugged in, you didnt have to do that.
And....

238
Brown:
239
 Like a jukebox?

240
Akiyoshi:
241
 Yes, it was more like a jukebox, not really, but its still a gramophone, it was
the same thing, except it was run by gears, electric.
And theyre bigger.
And that was
the first time I saw a V-disc (Victory disc).
V-disc was a 12-inch, you know, plastic, like
before that, a 17-inch, if you dropped it, it broke.
But this didnt break.
So that was like
a pioneer of, later on, the 10-inch LP, I think.
Because this was already 45 (RPM) speed.
And thats when ... daytime I could practice piano there and I listened to all those
records.
Thats the first, that was a really great job for me.
And then I ... and then of
course this was a large ensemble, so they had, you know, the stock arrangements, they
were given by, I think, the American side to the band.
So they were all stock
arrangements.
And then, stock arrangements usually, like a four-bars intro, then they
have ensemble, then there was a (place to) modulate, because the middle part was for the
singer.
So thats what ... since we didnt have a singer ... and stock arrangements
usually had a tenor solo, trumpet solo, something like that, then it was ensemble, then
finish.
That was a stock arrangement.
And I remember a lot of those.
And I remember
one was ... the pianist had nothing to do, you know, in a big band, just chang-chang, so
one day there was a new one, it was "Near You," and its middle part was a piano solo.
And I was very excited, of course (laughs).
So (scats) "near you" (scats) "near you.
" So
I was ... (in the) daytime I practiced my "improvisation" (laughs).
I practiced my
improvisation" like mad!
I was hoping he (Yamada) was gonna call that sometime, and
then one day he called it, and my heart went doot-doot-doot, so I played what I practiced.
So, Mr. Yamada said, "Everybody backstage!
" You know, there was a band room.
And
he said, "Did you hear her play?
Did you hear her play?
Just because she tried to come


up with something, she sounds like a Filipino!
" (laughs) Those days, Philippine players
had better sense as a jazz player, so obviously, because they were under, they were
colonized by America for a long, long time.
So theyre exposed to jazz longer than
laughs) Japanese.
And that was really funny!

242
Brown:
243
 So that was a compliment.

244
Akiyoshi:
245
 Yeah!

246
Brown:
247
 (laughs, claps) Well, lets go back, you said the first jazz recording you heard
was Teddy Wilson.
Teddy Wilson is improvising.
Up until this point, had you even
improvised?
Had you even ...?

248
Akiyoshi:
249
 Yes.
No, I prac-- I had to take from records.
I had to take the solo and song,
because I didnt know any songs.
So solos, and I tried to play that solo.
It doesnt make
any difference, especially when I was in Fukuoka, I took a solo, from eight bars, you
know, Wilsons solos, things like that, everybodys.
And then I tried to play it on the
piano.

250
Brown:
251
 So you were transcribing, or just by ear memorizing and then playing,
transposing to piano?

252
Akiyoshi:
253
 No, I had to play many times to, just to....

254
Brown:
255
 So you were actually writing and transcribing?

256
Akiyoshi:
257
 Right, exactly.

258
Brown:
259
 And then you used that?
Okay, so were going to change tapes.

260
Akiyoshi:
261
 Okay.

262
Brown:
263
 Okay, Toshiko-san, I wanted for you to, um, as much as possible to describe that
process, since you were classically trained as a pianist, and you heard Teddy Wilson, and
so, Teddy Wilson is improvising, so what is it ... how did you acquire the ability to
improvise?

264
Akiyoshi:
265
 By taking all (of it) from records.
(It) took me a long time to take it, because I
didnt have that quick (an) ear.
And many times, you know, play it, and then take it on
the sheet music, and then I tried to play that, as many as I could.
That is the way I
learned, mainly, the jazz language.
Also, the different tunes, you know, different....
Because there wasnt anything, books, or anything like that in those days.
Interesting


thing is, like--I said Mister Fukui, I told you about, so I was there (Beppu), and then I
moved to Fukuoka and I was in the officers club, and I did the same thing, listen to
records and take out, now... and I tried to play it on piano.
And thats how I learned.
Meanwhile, Mister Fukui sent me the book, How to Play Jazz Piano (possibly Modern
Piano Method, 1933), it was a piano kysoku hon (method book), you know, like a lesson
book, written by Vincent Lopez.
Id never heard (of him) before.
And as ... you have to
remember that Id just started, I didnt know anything about anything.
And when I think
of it now, apparently this was like a ragtime piano book, and, uh, this was the first time I
saw, what do you call, you know, stride, un-cha, un-cha, un-cha, stride.
Yeah, I saw, the
first time in my life I saw this, and it had "Twelfth Street Rag" and things like that in
there.
So, this was really exciting to me, and I was trying to play.
And, uh, Mister Fukui
much, much later, he was talking to me about his memories, which Id forgotten
completely.
He said, "I sent you a book, and a week later you sent me (it) back.
So I
thought, Maybe she didnt like it.
" And I said to him, I said, "No, I copied everything,"
so I said .... Now, when I start thinking, thats true, that happened.
So, he was really
encouraged, he probably felt like a Professor Higgins!
(laughs) Anyway, so ... that was
very exciting, doing all this.
But its mainly, learn (to) improvise or something by getting
to know the players.
In those days I had no discrimination, I copied everybody ... and,
uh, to get used to jazz language.
Then, as I mentioned earlier, on "Near You" I would try
to, you know, play my own, but not truly improvise, but it was practicing my
improvisation, and I kind of performed that, but do what I was going to do.
Something
like that.
So, by doing this, I learned a little at a time, I became my own.
I think its one
of the good things, I think about, is when you dont have a book, youre not learning from
a book.
But if you learn something from a book, you go one process, you go with the
head, then you have to digest that one.
But (if) youre doing (it) by yourself, copying a
book, copying a record and trying to play it, theres no one cushion.
So once you did
that, its already yours, digested.
I think its the hardest way but probably the best way.
Charles Mingus, when later on I was with his group, and we used to rehearse (at) his
apartment, he had no written music or anything, he sang (the melody), and you have to
remember that.
You know, I think thats the best way, to .... Small group, I guess, you
cant do that with a large ensemble (laughs).

266
Brown:
267
 Well, I worked with Cecil, Cecil Taylor does!
(laughs)

268
Akiyoshi:
269
 But thats the best way.
And, uh, my case was, thats why I say "learn by
yourself," by that .... Its always been one way, maybe, Im grappling, maybe ... it was
not so convenient a time as today, there werent any records available, you couldnt buy
them), first of all.
But, on the other hand, it was probably a good time, thats the way I
had to learn, which was probably was the best way.
So ... so, by the time when I went to
Tokyo, which was 58, I believe, somewhere....

270
Brown:
271
 No, 58?


272
Akiyoshi:
273
 No, gomen, Im sorry.

274
Brown:
275
 48, 48.

276
Akiyoshi:
277
 I think it was (19)48, uh, it was summer.
And, uh, I was a little bit, I was a
little bit, kinda, trying to play, improvise and so on and so on, you know.
When I went to
.. Mister Yamada, he was an old man, I mean an old-timer.
There were a few old
timers, Japanese old times, who used to play on the boats.
I think, one of the most
important, probably the one was (trumpeter) Mister Fumio Nanri, because (they) had a
Nanri award set up by Swing Journal.
Im the first recipient.
But, that was a long time
ago (1975)....
But anyway, he was a trumpet player.
And all those musicians were, after
the war, whenever they started they were the ones who used to be leaders of certain
groups, and so on.
There was a trombone player, played a little bit like Jack Teagarden,
and tried to sing like that, too.
That was in Tokyo.
So I really wanted to go to Tokyo,
because there wasnt anything in Fukuoka that I could learn.
And he (Yamada) gave me
an introduction letter to (one of) his old players, you know, old buddies, a drummer, his
name was Ikoma, Tokuji Ikoma, I think it was.
And also he gave me 5000 as a gift, you
know, a going-away present.
That was my monthly salary in those days.
And in those
days that was considered a very, very good salary.
And ... it was Tokyo ... there were
most, there were a lot of clubs, dance halls.
There werent any jazz clubs, its a dance
hall, and usually the top floor of a department store.
And it was one in Gotanda, it was
Shirokiya department (store), top floor, and there was a ... they were playing for the
dancers in the daytime.
I went there and ... he died several years ago, he was a drummer
called George Kawaguchi, who is very well known.
And, uh, most people dont know
that there was Teruo Yoda, he was a tenor saxophone player, and theres Fumio
Matsumoto, a trumpet player.
And they were playing.
And I thought, "Whaa...!
"
laughs), you know, "Whaa, fantastic!
" I was like watching, I was, "I wish I could play
like that!
" That was my ... so, as I say, I had introduction to....
This was a very
interesting thing about ... it was Ikoma and his band, this was a show band.
And Tokyo
station, Marunouchi side--I dont quite remember if it was six oclock, or five oclock, I
dont quite remember--but you had to be there.
Then you waited, and most of the time,
not all of the time, but most of the time there was an American truck (that) would come,
one of those khaki-colored trucks.
And we got on to that truck and went to the camps.
And, camp, there they had a show, and we had to back up, so we were a show band, so
you had to be able to sight-read.
So, I was a pretty good sight-reader in those days, you
know, so I got a job and that was ... sometimes a juggler, sometimes an opera singer
came, you know.
And I still remember, her name was Araki, I think, Miss Araki, I still
remember her face; she was a very beautiful woman.
But.
anyway, she would sing, and I
had to back up on piano.
All these things.
And the juggler was great, because the
juggler usually (was) a small-group jam session, because there was no music, other than,
usually had music and you had very little, said, "You go from here to here," blah, blah,


blah, so on and so on.
Juggler was just, "We want the tempo about like that" or
something, and we just had to....
This was (the) most, you know, fun.

278
Brown:
279
 You were mostly jamming.

280
Akiyoshi:
281
 Yeah, well, mostly, yeah, right (laughs).
I dont know how well I did, I
probably did pretty bad.
So did everybody else.
But, uh, that was ... sometimes wed go
to two different places in one night.
Go from there, go from there, something.
Sometimes no check would come and there was no job (chuckles).
Something like that.
It was kind of interesting because that was very good experience, because it was
something that you had to do at that particular moment (chuckles).
We got a job, I
should say he got a job at an officers club, St. Luke hospital at, uh ... its still there, at
Tsukiji, there was an officers club there.
And, uh, Mister Ikomas band got a job there
chuckles).
The first time I had this long dress (chuckles).
It was ... there, I had to wear
them, you know, so it looked nice or something (chuckles).
I was cursed ...
I think it was
..
I was seventeen years old at that time, maybe going on eighteen, something like that.

282
Brown:
283
 Were you the only woman in the band?

284
Akiyoshi:
285
 No.
There were no women in the band, um, there were no women in the
band.... Any woman in the band those days in Japan was a pianist.
There were no horn
players, in Japan those days.
Now, you know, now there are a few, but....

286
Brown:
287
 Now, when you first got to Tokyo, you said you saw the band, and you said,
Oh, I want to play like them.
" What style were they playing?
Were they already
playing bebop?
Or were they playing...?

288
Akiyoshi:
289
 Who?

290
Brown:
291
 The musicians, you said, when you first got to Tokyo.

292
Akiyoshi:
293
 Oh, no, no.

294
Brown:
295
 You said, "Oh, I want to play like...."

296
Akiyoshi:
297
 Those days, everything was swing style.

298
Brown:
299
 Swing style.

300
Akiyoshi:
301
 Everything was swing style.
So the drummer would play (scats), like that
chuckles).


302
Brown:
303
 Right.

304
Akiyoshi:
305
 Anyway....

306
Brown:
307
 Can you do that again?
(laughs)

308
Akiyoshi:
309
 (Laughs).
Anyway, so I was actually pretty in demand, because I was playing
like Teddy Wilson style, everything was that.
And there was a number one pianist in
those days, his name was Mister Matsui, Hachir Matsui.
He had, he was playing with a
small group, and there was another department store, the top floor, and, uh, Ikoma-san
thought I should study with him.
So he says, "Well, I dont teach, but if you want to
come watch me play, its fine.
" So off-days, which was quite often, I went to his place,
where hes playing, and it was called "Tokyo Jive" (laughs), thats the name of the group.

310
Brown:
311
 Jive.

312
Akiyoshi:
313
 It was a quintet (chuckles).
And, uh, I would sit next to him and I watched
him play.
I remember when I tried to play like that, I said, "Very soon, I will play like
Matsui-san," and Matsui-san was the leader and so I got a job with this trombone player
who had a band, in another department (store), called Isetan--its still there, though, in
Shinjuku, up there.
There was a ... this was for American people, and trombone player
was the leader, Toru Mori.
Tru Mori.
I was hired because I played like Matsui-san
laughs).

314
Brown:
315
 (Laughs)

316
Akiyoshi:
317
 Like that.
Then ... after that, I was ...
I was in a ...
I was actually, after that I
was hired (by) Tokyo Jive, because Mister Matsui got ... he had written some music that
became a hit, and he was hired by a movie company.
So I was his, you know,
predecessor (successor) or whatever (chuckles).
And so ... playing there, there was a
pianist named Akimitsu (Yoshitaka).

318
Brown:
319
 Akimitsu?

320
Akiyoshi:
321
 He came to me, he said, you know, um, "Maybe we (should) switch jobs.
"
And in those days there was a thing called "bebop," it was already in Japan.
And
grumbles), "Bebop, thats not music," something like that.
So, he was playing with a
band called Ichiban Octet...

322
Brown:
323
 (laughs)

324
Akiyoshi:
325
 ... group, and this was a bebop band.


326
Brown:
327
 Really?

328
Akiyoshi:
329
 So he really didnt want that.
He wanted to play swing style piano.
And so,
he came to me, said, you know, "Maybe we switch the piano, you play there, and I play
with this group.
" And then I said, "Well, I dont know," I mean....
But I thought, "I
shouldnt knock something that I dont even know.
I should learn, then knock!
" (laughs)

330
Brown:
331
 (Laughs)

332
Akiyoshi:
333
 So, okay, I took a job, I was the piano player with Ichiban Octet.
This was the
group that was playing in the Shinagawa depot.
This was the first, this was
predominantly black people.
I think maybe it was a sergeants club, Im not quite sure.

334
Brown:
335
 You said, where was it?
Shinagawa?

336
Akiyoshi:
337
 Shinagawa.
And there was a ... today Shinagawa ... today, its the east side,
which is the ocean side, there was nothing there.
Today it is the most hip place.
Even
Dean & Deluca has a store (there).
Its like a really upscale, and uh, (as) famous here as
the Oyster Bar in the station, (Grand) Central Station, they have a restaurant over there,
the east side.
But in those days there was nothing there.
And then, from that side, there
was this club.

338
Brown:
339
 And the name of the club again?

340
Akiyoshi:
341
 I dont remember.
As I said, this club is the ... the Ichiban Octet--I dont
even know if it had a name, because it was for the Americans, as I said, it was all black
musicians, I mean, excuse me, troops....

342
Brown:
343
 Black soldiers.

344
Akiyoshi:
345
 Soldiers.
Every once in a while I saw white soldiers, but it couldve been a
sergeants club, Im not quite sure.
But it was something to do with shipping, something
depot.

346
Brown:
347
 Quartermasters depot?

348
Akiyoshi:
349
 Yes, thats it, quartermaster depot.

350
Brown:
351
 Now, you mentioned a club, or a camp before, was that Camp Zama that you ....

352
Akiyoshi:
353
 No.


354
Brown:
355
 ...said the truck used to come and get you?
What was that?
Remember, you
said you guys would wait for the truck to come and get you and take you to a camp?

356
Akiyoshi:
357
 I have no idea where they were.

358
Brown:
359
 (Laughs) Okay.

360
Akiyoshi:
361
 But I know it was in Tokyo.
And as I mentioned, I said it would go from one
place to another sometimes.

362
Brown:
363
 Yeah.

364
Akiyoshi:
365
 So, Im not quite sure where they were.
I have no idea.
I dont even know
where Zama is even today.

366
Brown:
367
 (Chuckles)

368
Akiyoshi:
369
 But, so, that was, this was a totally different, one place and so on.
This band
was my very first bebop band, and they had like, uh, Illinois Jacquet playing, it was
called "Jet Propulsion.
" And he solos, you know, and the introduction was piano, da-
DAH da-da-da-da-da-da-dan-dan-dan, something like that.
Anyway, this was the first
time I really felt like I was in a jazz band.
It was really exciting and we had "A Night in
Tunisia," "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," all these stock arrangements.

370
Brown:
371
 Mmmm!

372
Akiyoshi:
373
 And there was a black trumpet player--I dont remember the name, I dont
really think I knew the name--he was, every once and a while, he rehearsed (with) the
group.
It was an octet, it was led by an old timer, hes a tenor saxophone player, his
name was Shin Matsumoto--um, Shintar, Shintar?
(repeats, Shin Matsumoto is correct)--I dont
quite remember his ... first name, but last name was Shin Matsumoto Matsumoto, he was an old timer.
He
was considered the "Coleman Hawkins of Japan" (laughs).
But it was playing ... that
was very, very exciting, it was like this particular one had stock arrangements, so they
had, like, the solo was always, you know, someone who played it, it was already written.
And Matsumoto-san would play this Illinois Jacquet solo.
It sounded so hip to me--
wow, thats fantastic!
(laughs).

374
Brown:
375
 So you had tenor saxophone, trumpet, uh....

376
Akiyoshi:
377
 Tenor saxophone, trumpet, and there was a G.I., Japanese American--I dont
quite remember, I see the face--alto saxophone (probably James Araki) He was the


saxophone, and the one with the glasses, I dont remember the name, he was the trumpet
player.
Then there was a ... tenor saxophone.
There was a guitar.
The guitar player and
I had a fight, so thats how I remember the guitar player (laughs).

378
Brown:
379
 (Laughs).
What did you fight about?

380
Akiyoshi:
381
 Ah, I dont remember, I think it was I never liked the guitar, you know, they
always kinda ... very difficult to play together, unless you have some kind of
understanding.
And of course I was immature, Im sure he was immature, too.
So we
had a lot of problems.
But it was ... the drummer ...
I wish I remembered the alto
players name, but he was a Japanese American, I think from Hawaii, I dont remember.
But there was, I think, it was an octet, maybe there was a couple of trumpet players,
possibly.
I dont remember, I dont remember whether this trumpet player wore glasses,
then alto, the lead alto, and Matsumoto-san was the tenor saxophone player.
There was a
guitar and drums ... drummer and the bass player I dont remember who they were,
either.
But, uh....

382
Brown:
383
 Did they really capture the bebop style?

384
Akiyoshi:
385
 Bebop style?
Probably.
I dont know.
I dont remember anything, besides
the fact that I was just introduced to it and I couldnt tell one way or another, probably
chuckles).
The first bebop players, at that time, there was young musicians, together
they were called CB9, for some reason.
They were playing in Yokohama.
And they
were the ... Jun Shimizu, he was the first bebop player, one of those, you know, broken
rhythm, he was the first one.
And, uh, Im not quite sure, but I couldnt probably tell in
those days if it was bebop or not.
I wasnt even in a position to criticize anyone
chuckles).

386
Brown:
387
 Had you heard, uh, Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie records by this time?

388
Akiyoshi:
389
 No, I hadnt.
But they used to sing in "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," dah-da-da-dah,
something like that, so on and so on.
So, still, I hadnt even heard Bud Powell.
That was
still.... Then after this ...
I was asked to play in another band, called Gay Stars
chuckles), thats a big band.
Then there was another one, this was called Six Lemons.
It
was Six Lemons ... by this time, I was really copying things--by the time when I went to
Six Lemons, there were jazz coffee shops sprouting in all places--and around those
times, I heard Bud Powell.

390
Brown:
391
 About what year is this now, maybe fift--.

392
Akiyoshi:
393
 I would say 50.
I would say 50, 51.
I would think 51.
But there was an
Armed Forces Radio Service, they had a jazz hour, and I heard this "Body and Soul" and


its beautifully played, and I said, "Wow, who could that be?
" and that was Bud Powell.
Since then, I tried to listen to him, and pretty much the same time there was a jazz coffee
shop, you know.
Those days, records were costing--I think it was the black market, you
could only buy in the black market--it was 3000.
And those days if you were a
graduate of an Ivy (League) college and got a job in a bank, the first salary was 6000 in
Japan, monthly, you know.
So you know how expensive the records were.
So these were
probably bought on the black market from a PX who would buy....
So my learning place
was the jazz coffee shop, and I went there and listened to records and tried to learn the
tunes.
And by that time there were many Bud Powell records and so on.
And the place I
went most was a in Yokohama, a place called Chigusa.
Its gone but....
The owner of
Chigusa (Yoshida Mamoru), he actually received a medal from Yokohama city, as a
contributor to the cultural scene of Yokohama, something like that.
He died quite some
time ago (1994).
But most jazz coffee shops were very small; this one was particularly
small, maybe like six people, be like, thats it.

394
Brown:
395
 (Chuckles)

396
Akiyoshi:
397
 And I would listen to records.
And uh, you know, as I said before, you cant
copy by (listening) one time only, so I would have to ask her, ask him, I said, "Im sorry,
but could you play that please again?
" and he would say, "Yes!
" and he would do that,
and I tried....
So, you know, this is the LP time, so probably quite a lot of his records at
one point were pretty, went down!
(laughs)

398
Brown:
399
 (Chuckles)

400
Akiyoshi:
401
 But those were very, very important school, you know, places for me, or
somebody like ... now, this was, I have another place about, away from here, its a little
small house that I work there, because theres nothing there, you know, no telephone or
anything, thats where I usually go to work.
But I put it there, but there was.... Quite
some time ago, I still had a large ensemble, and someplace, it could be Indiana, Im not
quite sure, (there was) a concert.
The presenter came to me and said, "I have a surprise
for you, somebody wants to present you something.
" And this man came with a sketch of
me.
He sketched while I was listening to records (laughs).

402
Brown:
403
 At the coffee shop?

404
Akiyoshi:
405
 Yes, coffee shop.
So he gave this to me and its in a corner in my, you know,
other place.
But, that was a ... coffee cost, I think, 50 in those days, you know, so you
had one coffee then you stay there three hours or something, chart another tune, or so on
and so on.

406
Brown:
407
 (Chuckles)



408
Akiyoshi:
409
 And Bud Powell record was ... the first one, I think he was 23 years old, his
first (as a) leader.
And my first recording, which was done by Norman Granzz, you know,
at the recommendation from the late <span class="fullMatch" id="match_53">Oscar Peterson</span>, I was 23 years old, so I thought,
Whoa, this is something!
" (laughs)

410
Brown:
411
 (Laughs) Lets go back to when you first got to Tokyo, um, about your
impressions of Tokyo, and where you first stayed.
Did you have any con ... you had this
letter of introduction,

412
Akiyoshi:
413
 Yes.

414
Brown:
415
 you had a job....

416
Akiyoshi:
417
 No, no, no.

418
Brown:
419
 ...but did you have a place to stay?
How did you, what was your social
situation?

420
Akiyoshi:
421
 My mothers friend was quite wealthy, they had a house in Setagaya, and
uh....

422
Brown:
423
 Where?

424
Akiyoshi:
425
 Setagaya, which is like, uh ... here it would be, say, oh....

426
Brown:
427
 Well, I have a map of Tokyo, would it be...?

428
Akiyoshi:
429
 Yes, Setagaya-ku (ward), yes.
Setagaya-ku is a more residential area.
They
have a densha (train) from Shibuya station to, on the way to Yokohama.

430
Brown:
431
 Oh, Shibuya.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

432
Akiyoshi:
433
 They had a house, so I had one room upstairs they rented to me.
So, those
days ... later, yeah, I also left there and went to other places.
But its always, those days
I was always renting one room or the upstairs.
Later on, before, maybe a year before I
came to this country, I was in Shinagawa, and upstairs.... See, in those days, after the
war was ended, many, relatively wealthy people lost income, so they rented out rooms for
the income.
So there was quite a lot of those, yknow.
And, uh, the last one I had, they
converted so there was a kitchen upstairs, and things like that.

434
Brown:
435
 So you actually didnt have a piano in your house where you lived.


436
Akiyoshi:
437
 No.
I did not have a piano til, uh, when I was in the Blue Coats Orchestra, so
that would be 50, 1950, I think.
I think I went to Tokyo in 48, so didnt have any....
But 1950 I was asked to join what was called the Blue Coats Orchestra, and theyre more
like....

438
Brown:
439
 Blue Coats?

440
Akiyoshi:
441
 Blue Coats, you know, right.
And it was funny ... they were very much in a
Les Brown bag kind of thing, more like a dance band, like a middle-of-the-road kind of
thing, and they had ... they asked me to join the orchestra, and my condition was, "Give
me an advance and I can buy a piano.
" So thats what I did.
Thats the first time I had
my (own) upright piano.
And (at) that time I was renting a room that was six mattress
size), you know, rokuj, we call it.
And, uh, I had a piano and I had a bed and it was
very exciting to me (laughs gaily).

442
Brown:
443
 You remember what kind?

444
Akiyoshi:
445
 Uh, it was called Bruckner.
I think it was called Bruckner.
And, uh ... it
really didnt matter to me, whatever, it was okay.
But that was called Bruckner and....
Soon after I bought the piano, the Blue Coats were playing at a Yokohama place, a
civilian club, called the Colonial Club, called Club Colonial, a civilian club.
Les Brown
and Bob Hope came for a USO tour and they played at the stadium in Yokohama and uh
.. for the Americans, you know, you (Japanese) couldnt get in there.
But I kind of
snuck in there (laughs).
Anyway, I got to know the pianist, I think his name was Jeff
Clarkson.
I think his brother used to play with Gene Krupas trio, and I think he was the
brother.
I think he was called Jeff Clarkson.
I asked him to come and play for us.
And
he came to my little place.
We all were kind of excited--I wasnt the only one, there
were others and so on--and he played my piano, you know.
It was "I Got You (My Love
to) Keep Me Warm" or something like that (sings)....

446
Brown:
447
 "Ive Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.
"

448
Akiyoshi:
449
 ...and its got a little piano solo.
I used to play just like that (laughs).
It was
very good, thats the first piano I had, very, very exciting.

450
Brown:
451
 So, that means now youre working at the Colonial Club in Yokohama.
Are you
still working with..., are you working in many bands at this time?

452
Akiyoshi:
453
 No, I moved from one band to another quite, probably three months at a time.
The longest one probably I was--that is, in Tokyo--the longest one probably was maybe
around six months, it was the first band, maybe ... God, uh ... maybe about that much


with the Ichiban Octet.
But most of the time three months with the Blue Coats to Gay
Stars.
After Gay Stars there was a small combo called Six Lemons.
This was....

454
Brown:
455
 Six Lemons?
(chuckles)

456
Akiyoshi:
457
 Six Lemons.
These were supposed to be the best young players.
There were
no jazz clubs and there was a new nightclub, which opened in Ginza.
The manager
was--I forgot the name--he was supposed to be the nightclub manager, and he wanted to
have all the best young musicians together, a sextet, for playing.
And he was asked by ...
I mentioned before, Yoda, Teruo Yoda, who was a tenor saxophonist and played quite
well--he was more like, somewhere between Flip Phillips and, uh, a little like ... you
know, that kind of style, kind of....
So he gathered the musicians and I was elected as the
piano player.
And so we were there.
The drummers name was Frankie Sakai; later on
he became an actor, a movie actor, he actually was quite good at it, he got some kind of
award.
He died quite some time ago.
But he was a natural comedian and there was a
song called "Orange Colored Sky," something like that, and he sang.
And I really hated
it.
So he and I had a big fight (laughs), and I left in the middle of the....
In those days I
had a hot temper.
And, uh, I left and I went back, this was a different place, where I had
a room rented.
And I heard something in the window, I heard Yoda Teruo Yoda, he said,
Apologize to her.
Apologize to her.
Shes only a woman.
" (laughs heartily) But
anyway, this was a sextet, we played, and that time--Im sure it was (19)50--the
nightclubs in Japan, there were always girls, you know, beautifully dressed girls around
and da-da-da, and thats when Oscar Pettiford came with his troops to play (at) that Ernie
Pyle theater.
And the Ernie Pyle theater, you (Japanese) couldnt get in, but by that time
Id developed my, what do you call, okkake, here they call ... they call, you know, people
who follow you, fans, not a fan, but you have another word for it....

458
Brown:
459
 Not a stalker?
(laughs)

460
Akiyoshi:
461
 No.
I will think of it in a minute.
So we call it okkake in Japan.

462
Brown:
463
 Like devotee?
No?

464
Akiyoshi:
465
 No, uh, groupie.

466
Brown:
467
 Groupie!
Okay (chuckles).

468
Akiyoshi:
469
 I had groupies, I had American groupies, and they would come ... you know,
this was a Japanese club so Americans are not supposed to be there.
So I had these
groupies, about four of them, they were in the backstage and listening.
And this club,
downstairs there was a coffee shop, Japanese coffee shops are usually restaurants.
Every
once in a while the MPs would come.
So MPs would come, and they would go


downstairs (laughs).
So they were the groupies.
One of the groupies, his nickname ...
we used to call him "Mac," because his whole full name was McCutchen--I dont quite
remember the first name (Harry), but McCutchen--and he was an Air Force sergeant or
something and he was a jazz fan and one of the groupies.
And he told me about Oscar
Pettifords group, and that he would take me to backstage.
And he took me to backstage
and I saw ... this was the first time in my life I saw people warming up.
You know, Id
never seen that, Japanese players (were) never warming up.
And ... J.J. Johnson ... this
group was Oscar Pettiford, J.J. Johnson, Howard McGhee, Rudy Williams, who I didnt
know then, there was (drummer) Charlie Rice, and there was a guitar player (Skeeter
Best).
And because it was a USO tour, they didnt have a pianist.
But I heard J.J.
warming up and that really impressed me, and McKutchen, Mac, said, "Well, this is
Toshiko Akiyoshi, a pianist," and they said, "Oh, hi, excuse me, I have to warm up," and
you know, so.... That was really my first ... "Wow," you know, "a great player like that,
playing a long tone.
" And uh, so I asked ... by the time I was listening to them my job
had already started.
I could tell Yoda-san was steaming mad that "the pianist is not
here.
" And so I asked them to come to where I worked, it was a nightclub.
So ... J.J.,
Oscar Pettiford--I, actually I have a picture somewhere--but anyway, Howard McGhee,
they came, so naturally Yoda-san was very mad, but I came with them so I was forgiven,
so to speak.
And we had a little jam session.
But when I played--at that time I played, I
think I played, probably, "Squatty Roo," I have a feeling I probably played "Squatty
Roo.
" And J.J. said, "Ah, so you like Bud Powell!
" And uh, I really loved Miles Davis,
you know (mumbles), I said, "Hows Miles doing?
" He said, "Oh, you like Miles Davis, huh?
Hes not working.
" (laughs) This was, like, 1950.
I dont think he was working.
That
was ... those (guys) were the American jazz scene.
The fact is, when I came (to
America) in 56 and in 57, I was at the Hickory House for six weeks.
Oscar Pettiford
used to come almost every night and sit in.
And that was the greatest lesson you could
ever have.
On the other hand, when you think about that, why he could come almost
every night, (it was) because he wasnt working.
You know, nowadays if he was, today
people would pay a premium to listen to him.
So those were the days, I think, in a way.

470
Brown:
471
 J.J. didnt explain why Miles Davis wasnt working?
Did he give any indication why?

472
Akiyoshi:
473
 No, he just said, "Hes not working," thats all.
Anyway, there werent that
many jobs, probably, because Oscar Pettiford, it was the same thing much later, like six,
seven years later.
But, um, that time ...
I started thinking about that I really didnt want
to play in a dance band, you know, dance music.
You had to play dance music, of
course, thats what it was for.
So I made my own group.
I quit and I made my own
quartet and ... how I named it, I said it was small, so I named it the Cozy Quartet.
So it
was called Cozy Quartet, first one.
That was my first one.
And, uh, til then I was the
top-paid sideman, sideperson, player in Japan, I was getting 50,000, which today ... if I
were a little clever, if I were a little more, better minded person rather than just thinking
of playing, playing, playing, I wouldve bought land.
Id have been a billionaire today


laughs).

474
Brown:
475
 (laughs)

476
Akiyoshi:
477
 But its okay.
Everything works out.
But it was, I just ... that was a departure
for me.
And after that, I had a very difficult time, you know, economically at that time.
But, I didnt stop, so I was somehow ... since then, most of the time, I would start
playing at a place like a service club, because you could play (jazz), and my best job was
in Yokohama, a place called Seamens Club.
And it was a small ... it was a seamens
club.
Almost once a week they had a fight, you know, a big fight.
The owner, I think,
was a Marine lawyer or something, American, who was married to a Japanese.
The lady
was a beautiful lady, used to be an old titled familys daughter.
Anyway, and sometimes
the owner would try to stop a fight, and it was (?
?, laughs), it was horrible, it was awful.
But you could play anything you want.
And that was an important place, because it was
in Yokohama.
Yokohama had a (military) camp.
Thats where Hampton Hawes was.
And not only that, there was Hal Stein, who later on was with Charles, Ray Ch..., not
Ray Charles, uh, the vibraphone player, the Teddy Charles....

478
Brown:
479
 Teddy Charles.

480
Akiyoshi:
481
 ...group.
And Buddy (Walter) Benton, who no one knew (in) those days, but
played really good, you know.
And he was the one who used to show me the tunes, like
Indiana.
" I didnt know the tune, its like, "Back home Indiana," all those tunes I
learned from what we called "Saig-san," you know, he looked like Saig (Takamori,
famous samurai leader of the Meiji Restoration)-san .
So, that was a very important place
for me and uh, everything, anything.... And also, going home, Id stop at Chigusa and
listen to records and (have) coffee, and so on and so on.
And that was very, very, you
know, important.
Before that, I have to mention about 53, 1953 I already had my own
group, as I said, sometimes (wed) get a job, I dont have a job, and then I would just be
by) myself.
And there was a very popular group called Six Joes.

482
Brown:
483
 Six Joes.

484
Akiyoshi:
485
 Six Joes.
And there was, uh, the leader was a bass player named Shin
Watanabe.
He later on formed Shin Watanabe Productions, the production (company).
If it
werent for that production (company), you couldnt have any television program,
something like that.
It really became... and he was a bass player, and he also died, but
the tenor player was one of the best, actually, probably one of the two best tenor players,
this one we used to call "Sleepy," because he looked like he was sleeping all the time.
It
was Hidehiko Matsumoto ... maybe, I dont quite remember ... Hidehiko Hidehiko Matsumoto.
Hidehiko Matsumoto.
And he was a tenor player, and he was a very, very counted player.
And there was a
vibraphone player, then there was ... anyway, Six Joes, so it was the most popular group.

Then, 1953, the first live house, jazz club in Tokyo, and....

486
Brown:
487
 Live house?

488
Akiyoshi:
489
 Yeah, live house, the first one.
Um....

490
Brown:
491
 Where was it in Tokyo?

492
Akiyoshi:
493
 Theyre called "live houses" in Japan.

494
Brown:
495
 Where was it in Tokyo?
What section?

496
Akiyoshi:
497
 West, Ginza.
Ginza, nana-chme, roku-chme (city block 7 or 6), second one,
roku-chme (block 6).
Ginza is seven chme, but the second one, and the west side of the
main street.
Main street of Ginza, west side, and uh.... (It) opened October 15.
The man
asked the Six Joes, you know, Watanabe-san, to play the (opening) night, and there was a
charge of music, another was, he was ... daytime.
So he came to me--he always liked
my playing--and he said, "You get the best ones you want to get," you know, maybe like
a quintet to play in the daytime.
I played from, like, 12 to 6 or something.
And he
Watanabe) played from 7 to 11, something like that, I dont know ... Im not quite sure
of accurate hours, daytime.
I had an evening, already had a job, and I had a quartet, and
thats the first time Sadao Watanabe, who is very famous today, he was maybe 18 years
old, and I had him.
He was the first one who sounded like a bebop player.
He sounded
very much like Jackie McLean, that kind of sound, you know.
Anyway, so ... when
Shin) Watanabe-san asked me to do it, Sadao Watanabe was a little bit too ... its not
quite, quite ... so at that time there was a more established alto player and there was
another tenor player who played very well, Miyazawa, Akira Miyazawa, who was also
very a good player and had a quintet in the daytime.
So, November 3, I dont remember,
 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, or 3, 4, 5, I dont remember, but three days, Norman Granzz brought
<span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_881_622907">JATP</span> (Jazz at the Philharmonic) to Japan and played the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_881_622883">Nichigeki</span>, which no longer
exists, but in Yrakuch.
This was the first group that came to Japan to play for a
Japanese audience.
Before that, there was, I said, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_92">Oscar Pettiford</span>s group, and the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_883_624284"><span class="fullMatch" id="match_93">Gene
Krupa</span> <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_885_46">Trio</span></span> was there, and actually, Louis Armstrongs group was there, too.
But they were all
USO tours.

498
Brown:
499
 USO tours.

500
Akiyoshi:
501
 So, this was the first one.
And, uh, Oscar Petersons trio, and Ella Fitzgerald,
you know, and all these ... Flip Phillips, Ben Webster, I think was there, I dont know.
But Roy Eldridge, and Charlie Shavers, I think.
But, anyway, they came and played.
And someone brought--I wish I know who that is, because I couldnt possibly, how I can
thank him, I dont know, but (he was) Japanese, I know--he brought Oscar Peterson and


Flip Phillips to this live house when I was playing.
And we ... so he listened to (me) a
bit and came to me while I was playing and said, "Are you playing somewhere tonight?
"
and I said, "Yes, Im playing dah-dah-dah-dah," and he said, "Okay, Ill come again,
because I have to go to work now.
" Then he came again (in the) evening, to a place that
was called Club New Ginza, it was mostly for the Americans, and it was kind of like a ...
balcony, stairs, you know.
And he came and he listened and he played, too, he played,
too.
And he said, "I want you to come at three oclock to the hotel," and I said .... And
he ... told <span class="fullMatch" id="match_103">Norman Granzzz</span>, he said, "You should record her.
" Thats how my recording came, you
know.
And ... this is also like, say, luck was involved, I think, in timing, because if the
live house wasnt open, he would not have (had) an opportunity to listen to me.
So
everything is kind of timing, you know.
So I consider myself very lucky that the place
was open at that time and that I was asked by Watanabe-san to have my group play, you
know, quote-unquote "all-star," you know (chuckles), quintet, whatever it is.
So,
everything I think had a lot to do with timing, and luck was involved, you know.

502
Brown:
503
 Before we go on to your recording, um, who else was in the rhythm section of
your quintet, this "all-star" quintet?

504
Akiyoshi:
505
 Youre talking of ... my ...?

506
Brown:
507
 The one that you got together....

508
Akiyoshi:
509
 Oh, there was a ... drummer and bass player were from my quartet....

510
Brown:
511
 From your quartet?

512
Akiyoshi:
513
 My quartet, yes....

514
Brown:
515
 So who were the original personnel of your quartet, your first group?

516
Akiyoshi:
517
 Quartet is ... Jun Kawaguchi--he also died, he was a young man, but--he was
then a bass player.
We used to call (him) "Omasuzu," thats his nickname.
And he
couldnt really understand, you know, the things ...
I had to write it, all the notes, so its
the kind of right notes to play....

518
Brown:
519
 So you had to write out all the walking bass (lines)?
Everything?
(laughs)

520
Akiyoshi:
521
 Yeah, all the walking bass, cause he wasnt a walking bass player.
I dont
really know how many walking bass players existed in those days, you know.
But, uh, at
least there was somebody--Watanabe-san was (one of them)--they understand the
chord) changes and so on.
This man didnt quite understand everything.
So ... and I
had my particular way I wanted to hear.
I didnt want to hear certain notes.
So I,


consequently I had to write all the notes (laughs).

522
Brown:
523
 (Laughs) You have to write everything you want to hear!

524
Akiyoshi:
525
 Yeah, right, exactly.
So, that was a ... so everything, I think, all had to do
with the timing.

526
Brown:
527
 Yeah, absolutely.
So ... <span class="fullMatch" id="match_105">Oscar Peterson</span> recommends to Norman Granzz that he
should record you.
So then what happens?
So you met Norman Granzz, at this point?
Yeah.

528
Akiyoshi:
529
 Yes, I met ... he said, "I usually listen to a player before I record it, but Oscar Peterson
said that I dont have to listen to you.
We have to go to Hong Kong, but a week later
well) come back, so you select the music by that time," and so on.
And, uh, we
recorded from midnight, "Ill give you Oscar Petersons rhythm section," which was that ... and of
course Oscar Peterson didnt have drummer, so JATP--in Oscar Petersons trio there wasnt any
drummer--so JATP had, J.C. Herd was the drummer.
So J.C. Herd, and Herb Ellis, and
Ray Brown, that was the rhythm section.

530
Brown:
531
 So how was that?

532
Akiyoshi:
533
 I dont really remember, I think I was like this (probably makes a face), of
course.

534
Brown:
535
 (Laughs)

536
Akiyoshi:
537
 I really didnt think I could play, you know.
But once we started playing it
was okay.
But ... he would say, "Play six choruses," like that, and I have no problem
playing those--I used to play 20 minutes, wah-wah-wah-wah, you know.
And, uh ... one
thing about the Norman Granzz recording is that--I didnt think about it in those days, but
later on I thought about--now, who am I?
Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, you know, J.C. Herd,
I mean they were like real giants of jazz players.
They have nothing to play; <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_916_51">Norman Granzzz</span>
wouldnt let them take any solos or nothing.
Its all piano.
All piano.
Thats the way he
liked to record.
So, he liked to record someone, if hes featuring somebody, he features
somebody, thats it.
If you notice about Oscar Peterson trio recordings, its pretty much
like that, you know.

538
Brown:
539
 Feature the, yeah....

540
Akiyoshi:
541
 Yeah, thats how....

542
Brown:
543
 Well, Im looking at the discography entry for your ... Amazing Toshiko


Akiyoshi.
Thats the title of the record (laughs).

544
Akiyoshi:
545
 Is it?
No, Amazing, I dont think that was the one, though.
I think the first one
was a 10-inch (LP), the pink ... the cover, (there was) a flower coming out of the piano.

546
Brown:
547
 Hmm (chuckles).

548
Akiyoshi:
549
 Is that what it says, Amazing?

550
Brown:
551
 Well, thats what it is in this, this is the Tom Lord discography.
It has the listing
of tunes.
First tune that is listed is "Toshikos Blues.
"

552
Akiyoshi:
553
 See, that is Norman's fault.

554
Brown:
555
 (Laughs)

556
Akiyoshi:
557
 Because that is a Bud Powell ... a Bud Powell ... (sings) da-da-da-da-da-dahh, Bud Powell played
that one.

558
Brown:
559
 Uh-huh.

560
Akiyoshi:
561
 I think its called "Buds Blues" (composed by Sonny Stitt).
But probably he
didnt copyright it.

562
Brown:
563
 Ahh.

564
Akiyoshi:
565
 So <span class="fullMatch" id="match_119">Norman Granzzz</span> gave me credit, which I got ... you know, I needed that like a hole
in the head, everybody thinks I stole it.
But I had nothing to do with anything.
That was
really a drag.

566
Brown:
567
 So did you pick all the tunes, all the tunes that were recorded?

568
Akiyoshi:
569
 Yes, yes.

570
Brown:
571
 So this is your repertoire, then.

572
Akiyoshi:
573
 Yes, yes.

574
Brown:
575
 And you have "Squatty Roo"....

576
Akiyoshi:
577
 Yes.


578
Brown:
579
 ... "Laura," "Shadrach," "I Want to be Happy," "What is this Thing Called
Love?
" What were ... so when you got ready to make this recording, can you describe
the process?
You have these other three, as you say, great jazz musicians.
So whats the
process?
You just get into the studio and just play, or did you rehearse, or did you talk
about the tunes?

580
Akiyoshi:
581
 No, we never rehearsed.
We just went there and played.
So he just ... he
didnt like to take many takes, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_121">Norman Granzzz</span>, you know.
Hed just say, "Play once," then he
would say, "You play six choruses," like that.
And some had a bridge--some music
doesnt have a bridge, but some tunes have a bridge--sometimes the bridge was taken by
the drummer or something like that.
But other than that, there was no one, no one played
solos.

582
Brown:
583
 How was the feeling with the other musicians, how...?

584
Akiyoshi:
585
 Oh, they were very supportive.
Of course, they knew how nervous I was, you
know.
So ... they were very, very, very supportive.
Im grateful for that.
And its just
uh ...
I dont really remember anything, because I really nervous, and I was like that.
But, I was playing a lot before that, you know, before this happened, so I had no problem
playing, and once youre playing its fine, but before youre playing, you get really
nervous.
But it was, you know ... so, it went like that and.... Lew Tabackin, sometime, a long
time ago, first time he listened to that record, he said, "Boy, you used to play very fast!
"
chuckles)

586
Brown:
587
 (Laughs)

588
Akiyoshi:
589
 Yeah, I used to play very fast (chuckles).

590
Brown:
591
 I know that you mentioned, you know, the lineage of Teddy Wilson and Bud
Powell.
What about Art Tatum?
Does he figure in?

592
Akiyoshi:
593
 <span class="fullMatch" id="match_127">Art Tatum</span> was something that was ... when Norman Granzz, after recording,
he went back to the States and he sent me tons of Art Tatums (records), because he
recorded for (Granz), so he sent them to me.
And ... his recording ... actually, frankly
speaking, I neglected to say, but I heard his record before that, playing, uh, "Begin the
Beguine.
" And, uh, I think it was, I heard it at a jazz coffee shop, and it was really
amazing technique, the way ... and I think I sort of was....
But also, I heard "Elegy.
"
This is a masterpiece.
I mean, I ... Im not the only one: apparently Norman Granzz...
I
mean, excuse me, Oscar Peterson really thought so.
I understand he used to play that,
you know.
I have no chops to play that, but I mean, Oscar Peterson has and he used to play that all
the time.
And Ray Brown used to kid him and say, "Hey, hey, Oscar Peterson," you know,
Art Tatum is here!
" And he would say, "Oo-oo," and stop or something.
It made him feel


like that, (so) Art Tatum must have been really great.
I didnt get to hear him in person.
But
most recordings, it was really ...
I was amazed (at) his ability, and he would play one
after another, and if I know Norman Granzz, he probably didnt have a take two,
everything blah, blah, blah, and it was so many standard tunes and so on.
But, it didnt
really hit my heart.
The one who hit (my) heart was Bud Powell.
He was the one, you
know, who really hit my heart.
He not only had enormous technique--later I learned that
he was actually classically trained, which I didnt know that--but his ... his ... uh ...
actuation, he had a very unique way of accenting a certain beat.
It was a very ... his
own.
Although hes not exactly a smooth player, he was really ... and he was real
dynamic.
But he also ... he was another tree, family tree from Art Tatum.
He came out
directly from Charlie Parker, so hes basically the first bebop player, so he played very
much, his early ... if you listen, its very much like Charlie Parker, except he doesnt
have to breathe, you know.

594
Brown:
595
 (Laughs)

596
Akiyoshi:
597
 But he had ... and I really love the way he played ballads.
He was such, hes
got such a male romance and inborn ability, and I always thought, (swooning voice) "Oh,
beautiful, ahhhh!
" (chuckles)

598
Brown:
599
 (Chuckles) So were you happy with the recording once you heard it back, your
first recording?
I mean, cause now this is your document.

600
Akiyoshi:
601
 No, I had no feeling whatsoever.

602
Brown:
603
 (Laughing) Just numb, huh?

604
Akiyoshi:
605
 Yeah.
All I know was, it sent me ... the review, I think it was Down Beat,
said I had three stars, which I think was pretty good, you know, first one.
And the cover
got five stars!
(laughs)

606
Brown:
607
 (Laughs) The flowers coming out of the piano?

608
Akiyoshi:
609
 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(laughs)

610
Brown:
611
, Okay, um, (recording engineer interrupts) ... okay, sure.
Break time.
Look, the
suns out!
Amazing!
....
Returning again.
While we were on break, we were talking
about the possibility of..., while Toshiko was performing in the clubs in Tokyo, its
entirely possible, my mother was a native of Tokyo, Shinagawa, and my father was
stationed there, and thats where they met, it was dancing in those service clubs.
Its
entirely possible that my parents met while Toshiko was performing (laughs)!


612
Akiyoshi:
613
 Yeah!
Its entirely possible (laughs).

614
Brown:
615
 I think thats extraordinary.
Um, Ill definitely have to tell my mom about that
laughs).
So ... youve done your first recording now, uh, youve gotten, this is your first
exposure in America, youve gotten a review by Down Beat.
So what happens next?

616
Akiyoshi:
617
 Nothing happens.

618
Brown:
619
 (Laughs)

620
Akiyoshi:
621
 (Laughs) Actually, after that, my life was the same as before: I was still barely
paying the rent, and so on and so on.
And, meanwhile, as I said before, there were a lot
of American troops were drafted and stationed in Japan, and one of the persons was from
Boston.
And his name was Tony Teixeira--I understand hes also deceased--but he was
a guitar player.
And he said, "You know, you should write a school, theres a Berklee
School of Music, and you should write, maybe they can bring you over to the States.
"
And I really wanted to go to the States, for the reason, cause Id been copying the music
from records and Im listening to players, and by 52 or 3, Id become sort of like the
biggest, you know, frog in a very small pond, so to speak.
And then I couldnt really ...
as you know, jazz is a social art: if you are surrounded by better players, you become
better at it.
So, at this particular point, maybe I was the biggest frog in a small pond, but I
was just starting.
I was just ... there were so many things that I wanted to be able to play
with these players whose records Id been listening to all the time.
And it would be great
if I went to the States, Id be able to play with them, Id be able to learn much more and
blah, blah, blah.
So, I had written a letter--Im sure it was terrible English (laughs)--but
I got (it) proofed by, it was the guitar player, Tony Teixeira read it and he said, "Well, I guess its
okay," you know, "Its fine.
" And ... at almost the same time, thats when my record
came out, also, 1954, I believe, and so on.
So ... the school was like about 350 students,
its not like today.
And the founder was Lawrence Berk, Mister Berk was probably
looking for something to advertise the school, and uh, here comes the record, my record.
And in those days, if you said a Japanese plays jazz, it was like, something as if,
REALLY?
" You know, you couldnt believe from today.
Especially if it was a girl.
And its really like, uh ... and Norman Granzz recorded it.
So there was a lot of reason
for people to maybe pay attention, what have you.
So the school, basically, gave me a
full scholarship (to) advertise the school.
And in those days you couldnt come to the
States unless you had a student visa or a working visa, one or the other.
And uh ...
I still
remember the student visa was called an F-form visa, something.
Anyway, that finalized
.. and in 56, January, I came to this country.
It was Pan-American number one.

622
Brown:
623
 (Chuckling) Okay.

624
Akiyoshi:
625
 Four-propeller engine.


626
Brown:
627
 How many days did it take?
I know when I first went to Japan it took three
days: first from San Francisco to Hawaii, then to Wake Island (laughs).
How long, what
was your trip?

628
Akiyoshi:
629
 You know, I cant remember, but Im sure there were bom, bom, bom (many
stops).
What I remember about it is that there was hardly anyone on the plane.

630
Brown:
631
 Mmm.

632
Akiyoshi:
633
 And it was three seats, three seats.
And I was ... also, stewardesses were very
kind, not like today.
Today its like army surgeon or something....
But they were very,
very kind, and there were just not many people.
That I remember.
And ... what I
remember is from, it was Los Angeles to Boston--Im sure it stopped many places--but
I was sleeping and I woke up one day, landed and take off and so on, blah, blah.
And I
got into Boston at two oclock in the morning, Sunday morning.
January, Im not quite
sure, 11th or 10th, somewhere around there.
But it was a long trip, I know.
But it was
very exciting to me.
Id never flown before, so... (chuckles).

634
Brown:
635
 I want to talk about your experience: at this time, was it still called Schillinger
House, or was it already called Berklee?

636
Akiyoshi:
637
 It was called Berklee School of Music, because Schillinger House--and Mrs.
Schillinger objected to that, to use the Schillinger name--so Mr. Berk changed it to
Berklee.
Lee was his son, who is already retired.
When I went to school he was a little
boy.
And uh ... so Berk-lee School of Music.

638
Brown:
639
 Um, Im going to return us back to Japan, because there was something that was
written about you and your days in Japan, in Hampton Hawes autobiography....

640
Akiyoshi:
641
 Ah, ah, ah.

642
Brown:
643
 ...called Raise Up Off Me.
And page 62, hes talking about, he was talking to a
woman, a Japanese woman, and she says, "Ill take you to the Harlem Club, wheres
theres a girl, Toshiko, plays like Bud Powell.
" So, um, the Harlem Club, could you talk
about that?
Do you remember the Harlem Club?

644
Akiyoshi:
645
 Well, what I remember is that there was a bass player called Nabil Totah.

646
Brown:
647
 Uh-huh, "Knobby" Nabil Totah, yeah, yeah.
Arabian.

648
Akiyoshi:
649
 He was active ... it was Yokohamas, stationed in Yokohama, Im not quite....


Either 293rd Army Band, or 289th Army Band, I dont know which one, which.
But it
was ... he told me, said, "You know, Hampton Hawes is coming.
We are trying to get
him into our camp.
" So, to make the story short, so he came.
And, those days we had a
lot of sessions, jam sessions at night.
So he came to sessions.
And, as you know, he was
very sick, and he would play, and that was my first meeting with Hamp, was that session,
that time.
Then it was ... his job was in the Army Band, because there was no piano--
those days, the boats came in to the harbor at Yokohama that the band had to play for,
and his job was to play cymbals (laughs).

650
Brown:
651
 (Laughs)

652
Akiyoshi:
653
 I dont know how well he played the cymbals, but that was his job.
And uh, at
that time I mentioned that I was playing at the Yokohama Seamens Club, so he used to
come down and I asked him to play and he would play.
And I would listen to him play
and try to learn a lot, as much as I could.
It was because, you know, probably the first
noted musician as far as ... because before that there was Shelly Manne, I think it was
Shorty Rogers, probably was the leader, the writer.
They called them something "Giants"
Shorty Rogers and His Giants) or something, something, an L.A. band, it was a group.
They played and Hamp played a solo ...
I dont quite remember the tune (sings),
something like that, you know.
And he had such a crispy way of playing, you know, his
touch was very crispy, it was very, his own.
It was fantastic, and so here is the person I
heard on the record, and here he is in Yokohama, and I tried to learn as much as I could.
It was a pity, the fact that he was very sick while he was in the camp, still.
So he had a
lot of problems, you know.
He was probably one of the sweetest men that I probably
have met.
And in later years--much later, much later--and I was in an apartment that
was in Greenwich Village, 10th street, and he got an engagement at the, uh, the Village
Vanguard, for two weeks.
And it was very ... he hadnt played in New York in a long,
long, long time, and he came to visit me, and he had a new recording, with strings
Hampton Hawes Plays Movie Musicals, recorded 1969).
And he came to visit me, he
wanted to give it to me.
But he had his record in newspaper, to cover (it) up.
Now, most
players, they will show people, so that they can see it!
He was kind of like that; he was a
very sweet person, and he wasnt, you know, an aggressive person, and uh, he was a very
unique (in his) playing.
I think he influenced a lot of people and I am among those.
It
was great that he came to Yokohama!
(laughs)

654
Brown:
655
 Hm, well, he described seeing you, he said, and Im quoting: "...then this little
chick in a kimono (chuckles) sat down at the piano and started to rip off things I didnt
believe, swinging like shed grown up in Kansas City.
" So, you obviously made a big
impression on him, and then he goes on to discuss, he said that you guys became very,
very good friends, very close friends, and then he says that you went on to America and
made it big.
But he says he has--let me see if I can read it--uh, "Toshiko...," oh geez,
Im sorry....
Uh, he talks about a possibility of you two doing duets and what he says is


that it didnt happen.
Uh, "Later on she made it on her own in the States.
Anyway I soon
discovered she dug me for myself and we developed a lasting friendship.
The American
consulate arranged for us to play a concert together and the response was so good, they
contacted the Army to see about sending us on tour--Toshiko in her kimono, me in my
slick American uniform--figuring it might help improve relations between the two
countries, which were touchy at the time with the occupation still on.
But somebody
squashed the idea...." So....

656
Akiyoshi:
657
 Oh, I didnt know that.
Oh, what a pity.
He didnt tell me.
But that wouldve
been great, a great experience for me.
He was a really, really unfortunate person, died
very young.

658
Brown:
659
 Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so I wanted to make sure we covered that, since he did talk
about you.
I think this is one of the few accounts of somebody actually seeing you
performing in Japan.
So, now youre in America (laughs), youre in Boston, of all
places!

660
Akiyoshi:
661
 Yeah, Im in Boston, right.

662
Brown:
663
 Now youre taking lessons.
So talk about what it was like being in that school,
and taking lessons, and who the teachers were, et cetera.

664
Akiyoshi:
665
 Well, first, as I said before, I landed at two oclock in the morning, Sunday
morning.
And uh, three men, the first time I met: it was George Wein, uh, the founder,
Lawrence Berk, then George Wein Newport festivals public relations person, called
Harry Paul.
Those three people came to greet me at the airport.
Then, I learned that
evening was the Bud Powell Trios last day at Storyville, and I said, "Boy, thats
something!
"

666
Brown:
667
 (Laughs)

668
Akiyoshi:
669
 The day I landed, that was his last day.
And Ed Thigpen was the
drummer, who was drafted and was in the Korean War and he had a relief and came to
Tokyo and sat in.
See, the jazz world is very small, and so anybody who was drafted in
Tokyo, whatever it is, in Japan, theyd say, "If you go to Tokyo, if you seek for her
group, you can sit in and play.
" So thats the way itd always been.
So most of the
people who came they always kind of let me know they were there, and Ed Thigpen was one of
those and he sat in and played.
So, I knew he was with Bud, and he was there with Bud
Powell, and I really thought that was something.
And, as far as the school is concerned,
uh ... my problem was that I really didnt speak the language that well.
But, the good
thing about music is that, its not like studying English literature, so.... (laughs) That was
.. but most of the time ... the one that I started from first, at the very beginning, which I


know just about anything that they had to tell me.
The only things that I didnt know was
the Schi-- ... also they used to teach the Schillinger System.
They dont do that today,
but thats something that I didnt know, so.... To some degree that was very helpful to
me and it was ... it kind of accumulated my knowledge a little bit about certain
relationships between music and mathematics and what have you.
So on, so on.

670
Brown:
671
 So you already felt comfortable with music theory?
Youd already ... basically
taught yourself music theory?

672
Akiyoshi:
673
 Yes.
So ... but, what they ... if you know about music history--Im sure you
do--but, the point is, the theory comes after the composition, always.
So modern theory
and traditional theory is different.
Music was so ... theory is, put a very simple way, is
analyzing what happened in music, and make a theory out of it, which is not exactly, you
know, exactly, in my mind.
So it doesnt matter.
If you are a musically oriented person,
you learn by yourself and it still ends up musically.
And if you studied, youre not a
musical person, no matter how much you studied, you will not be able to create music.
Music is something like ... painting is the same thing.
Its good to have the knowledge,
but you dont have to have it.
Thats what I think.

674
Brown:
675
 Okay.
Before we continue with the school, I want to go back and talk about you
seeing Bud Powell...,

676
Akiyoshi:
677
 Yes.

678
Brown:
679
 ... because I wanna know what ... did you meet him?
Did you talk to him?

680
Akiyoshi:
681
 No, I was ... yeah, you know, because I knew Ed Thigpen.
So Ed Thigpen, at the intermission
time, Ed Thigpen came to me and said, "Why dont you sit in?
" you know.
And at this time--it
was a propeller (plane), so, I dont know, maybe three days or whatever it is, left for
departure--I hadnt played piano for probably like four days or something.
And uh, I sat
in, I think I probably played "I Remember April" or something like that--thats what I
think--but Im sure I didnt really play that well, because as I said, you know, I hadnt
played the piano.
But I heard Bud Powell laughing his head off behind me, and I finished
and I ... he took all, a deep bow.
He took a deep bow.
And ... this I have to mention:
later on--and there was something about Bud Powell, I had some degree of, uh,
something--because when I played in Philadelphia, in a place called Showboat, with a
trio, he would play at the Band Box.
In those days there were quite a lot of jazz clubs in
Philadelphia, and they were walking distance (from each other).
He used to come down
and listen to me.
And hed forget to go back to his job.
And he had a bodyguard,
because he was, you know, he had a problem and so on.
And, before that, it was even,
uh, the Hickory House, sometimes hed play at Birdland, and he would come to listen to
me.
And uh, same thing, you know, hed forget to go back, but....
The reason he was


listening to me was not the same reason I would listen to him or any other people.
Those
days, I would listen so I could learn something.
His case was ... he heard somebody
playing, obviously had (his) influence--and especially in those days, I played like Bud
Powell--and "Here (is someone who) obviously got a lot of influence from me, and its
somewhere that I havent been.
" Now, today a jazz musician goes to Japan maybe every
few months or what have you.
But the first jazz group (that) went--outside of Jazz at the
Philharmonic--was in 1961, Art Blakey, in January.
This was the first one.
After that,
you know, there were many groups.
But, so--Im talking about 56, 57, 58--no one
had) been in Japan and naturally he hadnt, and obviously he felt comfort, I think,
because he had a very difficult life.
Um, I read a book written by a Frenchman, and all
these things led me to believe he had a very difficult time.
And uh, it would comfort him,
I think, you know.
So he used to come listen to ... one time, he came to Hickory House,
he came and I asked him to sit in and he (??
), then he went upstairs--there was an
upstairs inside the bar--he played a little bit.
That was nice.
But its always something
.. then of course later on, he moved to Paris in 1958, and I got my first job at the Blue
Note in Paris in 1964.
Uh, April, "April in Paris"--it was nothing like that, though.
Cold
laughs).
Anyway, he had tuberculosis and he was in a sanitarium under the care of
Francis, Francis Paudras.
He would come, Sunday he would go to Francis loft and
Francis would take him back on Monday, or something like that.
But he ...
I think he
really wanted to go home, and finally he went back to the States.
But, because Francis
knew that I was kind of a disciple of Bud Powell, he had my recording, the one ... uh ... the
Storyville recording (The Toshiko Trio, 1956), with some of my compositions.
One is
called "Studio J" (on The Many Sides of Toshiko, 1957).
Thats the room where we used
to learn, you know, tunes, Studio J.
And Bud Powell listened to that and he said, "Did you write
that?
" and I said, "Yes," and he said, "Youre the best female piano player.
" He said that
to me, and that would carry me for a long time; when I had a hard time, almost quit, Id
say, "Well, Bud Powell said that, so I must have something," or something.
But, because
of that, I wanted to form the big band, because Lew Tabackin wanted to do something, you know,
not (that) I wanted to have a big band, so my job was to write the music, and thats why I
have "Studio J" orchestrated.
Many bands like that.
They especially like the shout
chorus.
So I have quite fond memories of Bud Powell.
I feel like its really karma, the fact that
he always seemed to be playing when I was playing there.
And it was ... the first time I
heard him in person, it wasnt like, uh, you know, his prime time, but it was amazing that
.. to ... not ... like almost like automatically moving, you know.
Im sure he practiced a
lot, you know, when he was in his young days, otherwise it wouldnt be like that.
And I
heard, uh, some tapes made in Paris, and it was this incredibly fast Bach tune (sings), so
he had things in the head and, uh, every once in a while that came out.
What I
understand, altogether four times he had electric shock treatment, which is not exactly
kosher, I dont think.
He had a really difficult time, I think.

682
Brown:
683
 Well, were gonna return to your experience at Berklee, but Im looking at the
discography, and its listing as your second recording The Toshiko Trio, and its Paul


Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

684
Akiyoshi:
685
 Yeah.

686
Brown:
687
 ... and this says its Storyville, Boston, recorded in Boston, 1954.
Is that
correct?

688
Akiyoshi:
689
 No, New York.

690
Brown:
691
 New York.
But it was in the States in 1954?

692
Akiyoshi:
693
 Ye--19, no, not 54....

694
Brown:
695
 Should be later.

696
Akiyoshi:
697
 56, I think.

698
Brown:
699
 Should be 56.
So, we should get in touch with Tom Lord and let him know.
Okay.

700
Akiyoshi:
701
 56, I dont know, George Wein was at that time music director, A&R man for
Storyville recordings.
So, we did two recordings in New York.
One was (with) Paul
Chambers--Miles Davis had some kind of problem with his throat, and they werent working--
so Paul Chambers and Ed Thigpen.
Another one was with Roy Haynes and Oscar Pettiford.
Ooh,
that was really something.
Yes.

702
Brown:
703
 (Chuckles) Yeah.
Well, the discography continues with several other recordings
in Japan....

704
Akiyoshi:
705
 Yes.

706
Brown:
707
 ... but well come back to that, maybe tomorrow.
But I want to continue on,
since were already at Berklee, so to go ahead and talk more about ... you said that you
got there, youre taking lessons, you already were familiar with a lot of the....

708
Akiyoshi:
709
 Yes, already I knew, but one thing about the--I think the Japanese, they dont
say anything, I mean, I didnt--that year, there was a Jazz at the Philharmonic that came
to the Symphony Hall, and Norman Granzz told Oscar, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_176">Oscar Peterson</span> came to see me,
and he said, "You should be playing, not (be) in a school," you know.
And uh ... and he
was very nice to me, and I probably wouldve liked to do that.
But I came with a full
scholarship and I didnt have enough heart to do that.
So, I guess it was a ... sometimes I
wonder if I wouldve liked ... most of the students came, especially from Europe,


someone like Joe Zawinul, somebody like that came to Berklee, then you know, got out
very quick, very fast and so on, so on.
But.
I dont think he came with a scholarship.
In
my case, you know, I felt like I had an obligation.
So that was ... and sometimes I
wonder about if Id got out and if I were playing, I wonder if Id have been a more, you
know, noted pianist, whom everybody would look for, as some kinds of pianists were.
But at the same time, I think probably I wouldnt be writing, or whatever it is, you know.
I think everything worked out the way it was supposed to work out.
So that was, so I
wasnt ... but I really wanted to get out.
My reason for getting out was to get the diploma
from, I mean, to get the Schillinger test passed, so thats what I did three years later, and I
got out of the school in three and half years, so....
But most of the time I was, like ... for
example, summertime, uh, there were six weeks, and sometimes I was at the Hickory
House, and the first year, I was playing with a trio, which was, at that time at the school
there was Jake Hanna--a great drummer who lives in Los Angeles--and uh, Gene
Cherico, who was a wonderful, wonderful bass player, who died quite some time ago.
But, uh ... trio, we used to travel and go to different places.
And it was 57, 58 we were
at the Hickory House for four, you know, six weeks or so.
So mostly I was playing, (??
)
hours or more (a week) of playing, playing different places, so on.

710
Brown:
711
 So this recording, The Toshiko Trio, that was George Wein?
That was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_182">George
Wein</span>s session?

712
Akiyoshi:
713
 Yes, George Wein session.

714
Brown:
715
 And ... do you remember much about that session?
You had, you know, Paul
Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

716
Akiyoshi:
717
 No, the material, was all ...
I chose.
What I remember about it was, I had
written a thing called, uh, "Lazy Day.
" It was a lazy day, Sunday afternoon, so it was
Lazy Day.
" It has, like, a little bridge, it has a little, the bass had to play certain things,
you know.
And Paul Chambers went duduladah, and he said, "Lemme try to figure out
the fingering," and went bru-bru-bru the second time, and I said "Wha--!
" you know.

718
Brown:
719
 (Laughs)

720
Akiyoshi:
721
 "Wow, hes really, really good.
" Thats what I remember.
My only regret is
at that time, Norman Granzz actually offered to record a duet with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_188">Ray Brown</span>, that hed
rather I came (t)here.
But in order to do that I had to fly to Los Angeles, and the school
rejected that, so I couldnt do that.
That was ... there are two things that I really regret,
because the school didnt give me the permission to do.
This is one.
Another one was
Oscar Pettiford, when we recorded that year, you know ... Oscar had, before I left Japan,
Oscar had two recordings of kind of large ensembles, which was kind of unusual: two
French horns, and he was playing the cello, and so on.
And uh ... theres some harp, and


it was kind of interesting music (reissued on the CD Deep Passion).
He had a two-week
engagement at Birdland, and he offered me a job to be the piano player.
And then, the
school rejected that.
The reason was, if I were to play in New York I had to be the first, I
had to be the leader, or something like that.
I didnt want to be a leader and somehow I
was pushed into (being) a leader.
I wasnt ...
I like, I would be the happiest person if I
were a great sideman, side player.

722
Brown:
723
 (Chuckles)

724
Akiyoshi:
725
 And uh ... that was ... but, I guess everything worked out the way it worked
out.
I learned a lot of things about being a leader.
So, thats okay.

726
Brown:
727
 There are some very interesting titles on this LP.
You have "Soshu no yora,"
and....

728
Akiyoshi:
729
 "Sosh no yoru.
"

730
Brown:
731
 They mustve misspelled it.

732
Akiyoshi:
733
 "Sosh no yoru" is a Japanese pop tune (composed by Saij Saijo Saijo Yaso and Niki
Kitao).
Pop music.
"Sosh" is the name of a place in China (Szhu).
Yoru is
evening," as you know.
"Evening of Sosh," thats how its supposed to be.

734
Brown:
735
 (Chuckles) Okay.
And then you have "Kysh"?

736
Akiyoshi:
737
 Hmm?

738
Brown:
739
 Another one called "Kysh"?

740
Akiyoshi:
741
 "Kysh.
" Kysh is like a nostalgic, you know, nostalgic ... uh, for where
you came from, youre kind of a little homesick.
Little bit homesick, its kind of like
that.

742
Brown:
743
 And then "Homework.
" I dont know, was that a...?

744
Akiyoshi:
745
 Huh?

746
Brown:
747
 Called "Homework" (chuckles), "Homework.
"

748
Akiyoshi:
749
 "Homework"?

750
Brown:
751
 Yes, so (chuckles) maybe somebody else took liberties with the titles.
Or maybe


somebody needs to redo this (discography) (laughs).

752
Akiyoshi:
753
 No, that "Groove for Toshiko" is not the same thing, as that one.

754
Brown:
755
 Oh, the other one.
See this is actually, this is the real title....

756
Akiyoshi:
757
 This actually, uh....

758
Brown:
759
 I think what Im trying to highlight here is that youre composing, so, several
compositions, but well talk about that later in the interview, your process of
composition, et cetera.
But the fact that, you know, you have several originals on this
session, so....

760
Akiyoshi:
761
 Yeah, right.
I think its, I started writing because, when I came to <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_1314_929215">Boston</span> I
used to, of course, I used to go every night to listen, and in those days like, uh, even the
big bands, like Dukes band or Count Basie band, would stay for two weeks, you know, at a
club.
You cant think of that today, but....
I was always sitting in, I decided that when I,
if somebody asked me to sit in, I was going to sit in.
You know, I decided that.
So, I
used to sit in with, Max (Roach) would let me sit in, Miles Davis would let me sit in, so on, so
on.
So ... but Diz had a big band in those days, and Phil Woods was, I think, lead alto,
and uh, Melba Liston was playing trombone.
Anyway, uh, I was sitting in, playing, and I
heard, "Bud Powell!
Bud Powell!
" When I played people said, "Aw, shes Bud Powell!
Shes
Bud Powell!
" And I started thinking, I said, "I guess thats no good, I have to, you know,
to try to find my own idiosyncrasy.
" One of the (reasons) I started writing, one of the
things that, I think, thats the reason I started writing, to develop my own idiosyncrasy.
So writing was something I was never interested in before.

762
Brown:
763
 Was your experience at Berklee, did it, um, uh ... highlight or advance this
compositional impetus of yours?
Did it help you in any way, or...?

764
Akiyoshi:
765
 I think it helped me to reorganize my thoughts.
But, I used to have ... you see,
before that, I came to this country, in Japan I had a nonet for the broadcast only.
For the
.. NHK had a jazz program....

766
Brown:
767
 We didnt talk about that.
Maybe we should....

768
Akiyoshi:
769
 Yeah, so ...
I had a nonet.
Those days I was influenced by, like, having a
good French horn player, you know, things like that.
And uh ... there werent any
Japanese French horn players that I knew of, so I had an American, uh, French horn
player who had been drafted.
We used to record at midnight for three programs, taping,
so on, so on, and I was, used to write.
Also, it was trial-and-error writing, you know, I
never learned to write.
But some of them worked out okay, and so on.
And uh, so I was


writing before I came to this country.
So, when I had this orchestration class with Herb
Pomeroy, and he said, "Well, youre not supposed to do this yet!
" you know, he said
things like that.

770
Brown:
771
 (Laughs)

772
Akiyoshi:
773
 (Laughs) So, uh ... it helped me to reorganize what I did.
I did ... in other
words, if I were to teach, that wouldve helped.
You know, I have no interest, but if I
were to teach, that was organizing your, in other words, organizing, systemize, and that
would help (me) teach.
But, as I said before, music, its not necessary to have all that, uh,
all that knowledge and all that.
Its good to have knowledge, I think, but, it doesnt have
to.

774
Brown:
775
 Who were some of the other students that you were in classes with?
You
mentioned several profe--, uh, teachers....

776
Akiyoshi:
777
 Yes.
Gene Cherico.
He was, he had a natural ear.
He used to be a drummer.
And when he was in the service he got in a car accident that hit a train, and he almost lost
his life.
So anyway, he, the arm, the surgeon took a bone from (his) hip and replaced the
arm, and he suggested he play the bass, pull the bass, to help (recover).
Thats how he
became a bass player.
So, Im not saying because of that, but he had a natural beat, he
was really a ... you know, but he had a tremendous ear.
He didnt know much about
theory.
And uh, sometimes Id ask, "How do these changes go?
" and hed say, "Well, I
dont know, I play a B-flat and I..." (laughs).
And Jake Hanna always had a beautiful sound; he
knew how to tune the drums, he was just fantastic that way.
I mean, he still probably is.
And uh ... so we had a very good time, you know, playing together.
And that was a good
.. there was a young player, at that time he was eighteen years (old) or something.
Im
not quite sure, there were two of them, one was called Jimmy Mosher, alto player--I
think later on maybe he played in Woody Hermans band or something.
But anyone was,
when I was in school, there werent any ... (tiredly) uh, God ... the most students were
on the G.I.
Bill, so they were not exactly, you know, little children.
They were on the G.I
Bill and a lot of them already were professionals.
But there werent that many jazz
players; I think it was mostly players in the big bands or something like that.
Herb
Pomeroy had a big band at school.
Later on, he had a recording called Band in Boston,
two of them (the other being Life is a Many Splendored Gig).
It was a very good band.
Great writing came from Jaki Byard--boy, he could write!
And uh, it was a very
exciting band, so I used to listen, every Monday night they played and I used to listen to
that.
But all the other times I went to Storyville (laughs).
And learning the tunes, it was
Studio J and that was on the first floor, a large room, and we had to learn tunes, (chord)
changes, and things like that.
You know.

778
Brown:
779
 Was there a piano teacher there or...?


780
Akiyoshi:
781
 Pardon?

782
Brown:
783
 Piano teacher?
Was there a piano teacher?

784
Akiyoshi:
785
 Oh, yes!
When I went to school, Mister <span class="fullMatch" id="match_205">Lawrence Berk</span> arranged for me to
have piano lessons with <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1383_92">Madame</span> (Margaret Chaloff Chaloff) Chaloff</span>, who was the mother of <span class="fullMatch" id="match_206">Serge
Chaloff.
And she was the student of a famous piano teacher, Madame Van Guelph
sp??).
And she was teaching at Boston University, so I had to go there to have a lesson.
But, she was wonderful because she taught me, more than anything, she taught me how to
practice.
That was (??).
But the school really wanted me to become like a, you know,
virtuoso player, because I had to play--I remember, there was Cacciatore, I think, it was
concerto, I think it was--anyway, I was struggling trying to play it.
And I had to play for
Arthur Fiedler in daytime (chuckles).
Arthur Fiedler said, "You shouldnt be so like that,
you should be (coos), walk out a little bit, look at the sky," you know, blah, blah, blah,
things like that.
But uh ...
I really wanted to be at Birdland, first of all, you know.
I
wanted to play at Birdland, but the school wanted me to play at the Hickory House,
because that had more merit or something, for pianists.
Maybe they paid better, I dont
know (laughs).
But all those Birdland things, I could do that after I left school.
And at
that time (my) manager was Oscar Woodstein, he was the manager, Oscar Woodstein.
Later on, I learned from Francis book that he was Bud Powell manager, which I didnt
know that.
And Oscar Woodstein hired me quite often, (for) which (Im) really grateful.
And I have no way of knowing the reason, but I suspect--after I read Francis book, that
he was the manager (for Powell)--that ...
Bud Powell left the States in 1958, so I think maybe
I) reminded him of Bud Powell.
Maybe, maybe thats why he hired me all the time or
something.
In those days, two groups, you know, so I didnt have to be (the) drawing
power.
I was able to be in Count Basie band and my trio, or sometimes it was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_212">Miles Davis</span>
and my trio, things like that, so.... <span class="fullMatch" id="match_213">Pee Wee Marquette</span> was the announcer and uh, he
would mispronounce my name.

786
Brown:
787
 How did he pronounce it?

788
Akiyoshi:
789
 I ... Tokisho or something.
I didnt know he was doing that purposely.
You
were supposed to give him money.
I didnt know that.
Gene Cherico told me, so I said,
Okay," so, and after that everything was okay.

790
Brown:
791
 (Laughs) Well, I wanted to ask you about, you know, you said that while you
were in Boston you got a chance to play with people because they were on extended
engagements.
You said you played with Miles Davis and Max Roach.
What were those
experiences like?

792
Akiyoshi:
793
 Miles Davis, he would let me sit in.
But when I went, he would lean on the piano


and hed watch me, my hands, like this, and I was like this (demonstrates nervousness),
you know.
And he said to me, "Are you nervous?
" I said, "Yes.
" He said, "Well, dont
be.
But I felt the same way with Bird.
" Thats what he told me.
Now, Miles Davis was not
exactly the way people think, hes an evil guy, so on, so on.
But hes not exactly like
that, you know.
He was a nice man; I think it depended on whom he was speaking to, he
probably, thats what it was.
But, as I said, if I sat in hed say, "Bud Powell!
Bud Powell!
" you
know (chuckles).

794
Brown:
795
 (Laughing) Right.

796
Akiyoshi:
797
 And Max Roach was ... he always played, firstly, always incredibly fast.
That
was his style.
So, first day, it was the second day?
The pianist disappeared or something.
So there was a pianist living in Boston, called Joey Master, he was noted, I guess, so he
was subbing.
But he (Max) always played fast, so (chuckles) Joey came up to me and
said, he said, "You want to sit in?
" so I said (??
laughing).
Firstly, Max Roach always played
fast.
And uh, the first time he had, uh ... Clifford (Brown) and, uh, Sonny Rollins....

798
Brown:
799
 And Richie Powell.

800
Akiyoshi:
801
 Yes, Clifford (Richie) was ... uh, Buds brother.

802
Brown:
803
 Yeah, Richie Powell, right.

804
Akiyoshi:
805
 Yes.
And uh, anyway--I think it was George Morrow on bass....

806
Brown:
807
 George Morrow on bass, that was the, that was that quintet.

808
Akiyoshi:
809
 But Clifford Brown was ... if you met him, I was so surprised, because if you
met him on the street, you would never guess he was a jazz player.
He looked like a--
and he was so sane (serious) too, he was very sane--he couldve been an insurance
company (salesman) (laughs).
I think he was, Max Roach was quite, quite ... attached to
Clifford Brown, because when he died by car crash, he really was, Max Roach was crushed, you know,
so.....
But that was the group.
Actually I had a photo in Birdland, I was sitting in--
somebody has it, anyway.
Max Roach never said to me, "Shes Bud Powell," but Im sure....

810
Brown:
811
 Well, he had Richie Powell!

812
Akiyoshi:
813
 Huh?

814
Brown:
815
 He had Richie Powell, his brother, on piano!

816
Akiyoshi:
817
 Richie Powell was ... what I understand is that Bud Powell taught Richie Powell.
<span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1428_113">Bud Powell</span> was


actually formally trained and uh....

818
Brown:
819
 What did you think of Richie Powell playing?
Did you hear him much?

820
Akiyoshi:
821
 Yeah, he played ... you know, played well, just like everybody else.
Actually,
I liked, I liked ... the first time when I was here, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_233">Miles Davis</span> group was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_235">Paul Chambers</span> and
<span class="fullMatch" id="match_234">Red Garland</span>, uh, Philly Joe Jones Jones (Jones).
That was something.
I really thought it was ... that
was like a modern, what do you call, Count Basie famous, you know, rhythm section, except
no guitar player.
But uh, it was really fantastic.

822
Brown:
823
 Was John Coltrane in the group, too?

824
Akiyoshi:
825
 First John Coltrane, then it was a short while, he was replaced by Sonny Rollins.
He was there briefly, then John Coltrane (came) back.
But before John Coltrane, after he (got) back
he would sit in a lot, and thats what the people know (as) John Coltrane today.
But the first
John Coltrane, when I heard, he was a little more like Sonny Stitt, kind of like that.
Except he
had his own little voice, you know; I mean his tone was a little bit different.
But he was
kind of a Sonny Stitt-type of player.

826
Brown:
827
 And you also had a chance to play with Roy Haynes, or sit in with Roy Haynes?

828
Akiyoshi:
829
 Oh, Roy Haynes didnt have a group.

830
Brown:
831
 Yeah, thats what I suspect, so....

832
Akiyoshi:
833
 He was working with Sarah Vaughan.
He was playing, backing for Sarah
Vaughan those days, so....
But he was voted (one of the) ten best-dressed men by
Esquire!

834
Brown:
835
 (Laughs) Esquire.

836
Akiyoshi:
837
 Oh, you know about that?
(laughs)

838
Brown:
839
 He and Miles Davis, both.

840
Akiyoshi:
841
 He was a sharp dresser.

842
Brown:
843
 Still is!
(chuckles) Okay, well, I think probably this is a good time to stop....

844
Akiyoshi:
845
 Very good.

846
Brown:
847
 ... and we can move on after your Berklee experience.
But we want to pick up


with talking about Hickory House, how you got those engagements, and now you start
your real career (laughs).

848
Akiyoshi:
849
 (Modestly) Well, I dont know....

850
Brown:
851
 In America, at least.

852
Akiyoshi:
853
 Yeah.

854
Brown:
855
 Today is June 30th, 2008, and this is day two of the Smithsonian Jazz Oral
History interview with composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader Toshiko Akiyoshi, at her
home in Manhattan, New York.
Konnichi wa, Toshiko-san.

856
Akiyoshi:
857
 Konnichi wa.

858
Brown:
859
 So when I was making the introduction, you kind of made a grimace.
Did I not,
did I leave something out?
Composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader....

860
Akiyoshi:
861
 No, I think you said too much (laughs).

862
Brown:
863
 Too much (laughs).
But, um, these are your accomplishments; theyre very well
recorded, so we have to at least honor ... some of them, at least, so....

864
Akiyoshi:
865
 Thank you.

866
Brown:
867
 When we left off yesterday, we were talking about, you had just finished your
tenure at Berklee School, and you were now going to launch your professional career.
But, you know, you did talk about that you were already performing in Boston and also in
New York ... you played at Storyville?

868
Akiyoshi:
869
 Uh, Storyville, I started to play Storyville in 56, March, from Thursday to
Sunday.
And uh, in those days, most clubs had two groups.
So the main group from ...
both in a seven nights term, plus a matinee.
So, but shorter hours than in New York:
New York, those days, was 10 to 4, and Boston was 9 to 1, and seven nights, plus the
matinee Sunday afternoon.
So, um, I started to play, but the main group was from
Tuesday to Sunday.
And uh, that was very good for me, because I could hear also ... um,
the school thought--I think <span class="fullMatch" id="match_252">George Wein</span>, actually, thought--that I should have a horn
player, so there was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_253">Boots Mussulli</span>, who used to be an old timer with Stan Kenton
band.

870
Brown:
871
 Whats his name again?


872
Akiyoshi:
873
 Boots Mussulli.

874
Brown:
875
 Boots Mussulli.

876
Akiyoshi:
877
 Boo--Boots Mussulli.
He was retired and he was from Milford,
Massachusetts.
And he was ...
I heard with a small group, recording, you know.
He had
impeccable technique, but for an Italian, he was very cold, kind of a very intellectual
player.
It was kind of like totally opposite of somebody like Charlie Mariano, who was
much more hot-blooded a player.
Boots Mussulli was much more, kind of, intellectual, cool
player, and it was very good for me that he was there.
I used to ... you know, I used to,
when I played, I thought I did something wrong--in my mind--made a mistake, I used to
put my tongue out, you know, like, "Aww!
" like that (laughs), so Boots Mussulli said, you know,
Don't do that.
Your mistakes are good: youre trying to build something from what you
thought you made (was) a mistake.
" He was very good for me, advice and so on.
It was
good.

878
Brown:
879
 And so the Storyville, was that something that was arranged through Berklee?
Did they arrange...?

880
Akiyoshi:
881
 Yes, yes, so....

882
Brown:
883
 And then you also said that you went to New York to play at the Hickory House.
How did...?

884
Akiyoshi:
885
 That was 57.

886
Brown:
887
 Okay, so this was later.

888
Akiyoshi:
889
 So, well, I mean, that ... the school asked the booking agent in New York
called Joe Glaser--the biggest one (client) was, I think, Armstrong.
Anyway, Joe
Glasers office handled my affairs and theyre the ones (who) booked my trio at <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_1515_1071191">Hickory
House</span>.
I said this yesterday, but I really wanted to go to a place like Birdland, you know.

890
Brown:
891
 Right.

892
Akiyoshi:
893
 But the school thought it was a better place, it was supposed to be a higher
profile for a pianist.
But, I had a lot of problems at the Hickory House; it was six weeks,
two years in a row, 57 and 58.
But they were always, "Play show tunes!
Play show
tunes!
" Because most of ... thats a steak house, if you remember.
And um, the stage
was in the middle part; there was a circle bar, and the stage was on the inside of the bar,
so the people look at (you) like.... And usually, most of the people came to eat, have
some dinner before a Broadway show or whatever.
After Broadway show theyd come


back, either they would have dinner or a drink or whatever it is.
Thats what, I guess, the
theme was.
Most of those places you had to play a lot of show tunes, and I didnt know
too many show tunes, and wed play Buds tunes or Monks tunes, things like that, you
know, they always really ... "Play show tunes!
Play show tunes!
" And I ...
I, up til
today I think I was booked in the wrong place.
But ...
I dont blame them.
I think
theres a place--I didnt know then, I do now--but theres a place for that kind of ...
somewhere between a cocktail lounge and a jazz club, uh, different from a Five Spot or a
Half Note or a Birdland, and that goes in a different category.
I know now, but I didnt
know then, so I was playing things that they probably didnt want to hear (laughs).

894
Brown:
895
 (Laughs) Did you ever get to play Birdland during this period?

896
Akiyoshi:
897
 Oh, after I got out of school...,

898
Brown:
899
 Ah, okay.

900
Akiyoshi:
901
 ...and I think I mentioned yesterday, the fact is I was very lucky, that was
Oscar Woodstein, who was my manager at that time.
He hired me quite often.
So that
was really ... and, you know, I was saying before there were always two groups, and uh,
even though I was there.... See, New York was a six-night town, and no matinee, but
long hours.
But, always the main group was there--I wasnt, I didnt feel that
responsibility for drawing people.
But he always, often hired me.
Im grateful today.

902
Brown:
903
 Do you remember some of the groups that you were on the bill with?
The other
groups?

904
Akiyoshi:
905
 Oh yes.
Sometimes it was Miles Davis group--only it was, John Coltrane was there
after Sonny Rollins.
That ... the old Birdlands band room, backstage, it was like what
we call ... Japanese have a saying, "a bed for an eel.
" In other words, long and narrow.
And thats where the backstage was.
But when it was Miles Davis group, they all played very
long solos, except Miles Davis didnt play long solos.
But ... hed (John Coltrane) play a long solo,
then it was ... John Coltrane would get off the stage and go backstage and try and woodshed.
And so you couldnt really use the room (laughs)!
That was a funny way ... and also,
Birdland was a very interesting place: that was the only place then, backstage there was a
little bar for musicians.
Set up for musicians.
And those days I wasnt drinking, so I
dont know how much it cost; I think it was maybe half-price or whatever it was.
And
uh, and those days it was the only club that took intermission ... excuse me, charged
admission, was Birdland.
That was the only place.
Every place, uh, some places mayve
had cover charges on the weekends, but they didnt have anything (on weekdays).
But
Birdland, you go step down, dun-dun-dun, then there was a little window just like a
movie theater.
I think it was $1.30, Im not quite sure, though.
Somewhere around there.
Then you go in there, there were three different sections.
Youre looking at the stage and


on the extreme right is the bar.
Thats where you ...
I think a drink was somewhere like
cents, it wasnt quite a dollar, I think, you know.
Then the next section was just chairs
only, where you didnt have to drink, you just--everybody had to pay admission--but if
you sit there, you could sit all night, not spending any more money.
Then, the third one,
which was the main part, where they had the tables.
They had a cover charge--I believe
it was $5, Im not quite sure.
I think it was $5--and thats where people could sit at a
table, but then you had to pay a cover charge.
But it was the three ... it was very good,
the fact is, if somebody was really into a certain group and they wanted to hear without
paying too much, there was a place where you could just sit, you didnt have to order any
drinks.
So that was a kind of unique place, I think, you know, for a long, long time.

906
Brown:
907
 How was the piano at Birdland?

908
Akiyoshi:
909
 The Birdland piano was not that great.
It was never gre ...
I dont think they
pianos) were their own, I think customarily they used to rent the piano from a piano
place, and periodically theyd change.
I remember much later, I was hired at Top of the
Gate as a soloist, in between other groups.
And uh, it wasnt a Steinway, but one time
they had a Steinway that was a ... this piano really liked me!
And we got along really
well, and if Id had the money I wouldve bought it.
But, it seems to be customary, they
kind of change, except the Half Note always had the same piano, I think.
But the places,
the Top of the Gate, they usually changed the piano.
Probably same thing at Birdland,
Im not quite sure.
But they had, at least they had a grand piano.
If you went outside
New York), like Philadelphia, I usually played--first time was the Blue Note, then after
that it was a place called Showboat--but they were all upright.
They didnt have grand
pianos.
And most of the keys were ... most of the places, it was upright piano.
Some
places ... there was a place called, uh ...
I think it was called the Dew Drop Inn, Im not
quite sure, I think it was called Dew Drop Inn, in New Jersey.
It was basically an organ
room.
But Sunday afternoons they had a jam (session), jazz.
And I was hired several
times but they always had a guest player--one time it was Jimmy Heath, another time it
was, I think, Diz--but this piano, a few strings were missing (laughs).
Things like that.
I
guess, some things have progressed today: at least you dont have pianos like that today!
(laughs)

910
Brown:
911
 (Laughs) You talked about a double bill with Miles Davis.
What was your
impression of John Coltrane?
Did you ... get to know him ... very well?

912
Akiyoshi:
913
 (Coughs) Well, the first time I heard of John Coltrane was in Los Angeles.
And uh,
with Miles Davis group with ... that was the first time I heard, uh....

914
Brown:
915
 Paul Chambers?

916
Akiyoshi:
917
 Paul Chambers.
And I think hed just joined, 56 January, because Id heard


probably heard every record when I was in Japan, and most of the players I knew.
But
Id never heard of Paul Chambers.
And uh ... boy, I caught the last set and he played,
took a solo, and I was "Boy!
" He sounded so good, I said "Ahh," and I didnt even know
the person, I thought, "My God!
What a country!
" you know.
People who had no names
played that great!
That wasnt the case, I found later on, but something like that.
And
John Coltrane ...
I think I mayve said this before, he sounded more like, a little close to
Sonny Stitt, then um.... One short period, Miles Davis had Sonny Rollins, and after Sonny
Rollins he came back, John Coltrane came back.
After that, it was a different John Coltrane.
He was woodshedding almost all the time, he was just practicing all the time.
And thats
what everybody knows, you know, John Coltrane today, I think.

918
Brown:
919
 So, uh, going back to the trajectory of your career: so, youre starting to get a
name, youre playing the major clubs.
Are you starting to tour at this point?
Oh, maybe I
misrepresented this.... (laughs)

920
Akiyoshi:
921
 No, actually, you know, after I got out of school and I moved to New York,
my very, original intention was, after I finished school, I should go back to Japan and I
was supposed to, uh, I thought I should, uh ... give to fellow musicians, you know, to
pass on something that I have learned.
But when I finished school, I didnt realize, and it
was just, "Boy, what did I do?
What did I accomplish?
What did I learn?
" I realized
that I hadnt learned anything.
I said, "Well, gee, I dont think I can go home now," so I
moved to New York.
And after I moved to New York, I was just like everybody else,
you know, just barely paying the rent.
Its kind of interesting, because Im basically kind
of shy--I think it comes up from my upbringing--so I had somebody come in from the
other side, and I knew who they are, who he is, or most of the men, the players.
Id say,
Oh, I dont think he knows me, and if he says hi, I think I might say hi.
" You know,
something like that, never....
So when I moved to New York, I decided that I was going
to push myself to say "hello," you know.
So theres Birdland ... and when I moved I was
staying in a hotel called Hotel Bryant.

922
Brown:
923
 Bryant.
Where was...?

924
Akiyoshi:
925
 It was 54th and off Broadway.
And uh, there was a ... 52nd and Broadway, as
you know, was Birdland.
But, it wasnt the corner, there was Birdland.
There on the
corner was a coffee shop and one day I went there to have some breakfast--in my case, a
late breakfast--and I saw Slide Hampton sitting in there.
My first reaction was, "Oh, Im
going to go home," but then I decided, "I think Ill go up," and I said, "Hello.
" He said,
Oh yes, please sit down.
" Then he said--this was kind of interesting--he said, "You
know, I used to think you were stuck up!
But I know you are shy.
" So I realized that
people do think that way, and I had to go up and say "hello.
" And also at the same time,
in later years, even today, some people, I think ... you know, like a little ... they think
they take themselves seriously.
And uh, then think about what Slide Hampton said, and say,


Maybe theyre shy," so I give them the benefit of the doubt.
So that was good that he
said that.

926
Brown:
927
 Youre starting to become a New Yorker now (chuckles).

928
Akiyoshi:
929
 Mm, I dont know; I was just like any other New York jazz musician who
didnt have much name and was struggling.
You know, I was, I became a part of it.

930
Brown:
931
 So, um, so this is into the late fifties now.
So in 1959, kind of a lot of changes
happen in your life.

932
Akiyoshi:
933
 Uh, it did?

934
Brown:
935
 Uh, well, you married Charlie Mariano.

936
Akiyoshi:
937
 Oh yes.

938
Brown:
939
 (Chuckles)

940
Akiyoshi:
941
 Yes and uh, right.
And that ... we moved to New Jersey.
And we formed a
quartet.
Before that, I was always with a trio, so we had a quartet.
But it was the same
time.... And, my job was not only that I had to call Joe Glaser office every once in a
while, to say, "Do you have anything for us?
" Cause as it was, theyd forget, so it was
something periodically, I had to do to do that.
That was ...
I wasnt quite comfortable
with that, but it was, that was necessary.
And sometimes theyd say, "Oh yes, we have
some place in Pittsburgh," or things like that.
But its amazing, actually, (that we)
survived.
Always, something came up, so that we could pay the rent.

942
Brown:
943
 How did you meet Charlie Mariano?

944
Akiyoshi:
945
 School.
He was ... when I was still in school, he was in Shellys group, Shelly
Mannes group in Los Angeles.
But he was originally from Boston.
And uh, he decided
to come home.
So when he came back to Boston, he started teaching school.
Thats how
I met him, you know.

946
Brown:
947
 And it ... you had a quintet as well as a quartet with Charlie Mariano?

948
Akiyoshi:
949
 No, quartet.

950
Brown:
951
 Just only a quartet?

952
Akiyoshi:
953
 Just a quartet.


954
Brown:
955
 Okay, so that needs to be corrected ... the Grove lists a quintet, as well.
And
you had personnel, was Gene Cherico and Jake Hanna first, or no?

956
Akiyoshi:
957
 No, the time when we had a quartet together, Jake Hanna was already, hed left
school--I think he was playing with Woodys band--it could be, I think it was Woody
Hermans band.
It could be Maynard Fergusons (Ferguson), Im not quite sure about that part.
But, so, Gene Cherico, always he had a knack for finding a drummer.
We had a job in
Hartford, a place called High Brein (sp??
) Lounge--or Few Brein (sp??
), I dont know
how to pronounce it--it was a beer company or whatever.
Anyway, we were looking for
a drummer, Gene Cherico said, "Oh, theres a drummer, Eddie Marshall," you know, "he is really
good!
" And he was about twenty-, maybe, two years old or something.
"We should try
him!
" So we went to High Brein Lounge and he came--hes from Springfield,
Massachusetts--so he came and sat in and played.
I really liked it, of course, and Gene Cherico
.. usually bass players and drummers, if theyre getting on well, thats a good rhythm
section so.... And Eddie Marshall was so nervous (chuckles), he spilled water onto Marianos lap.
He still is a very good friend of mine and also I, you know, often play with him, and uh
.. theres something about when youre young, when you play together for a while, its
always something special.
So after that, it was Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico, thats the group we went
to our first Japanese trip, to Japan, the concert trip to Japan was 61.
That was the first
one, after five years in this country, it was the first time I was back in Japan.
And it was
Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico.
And it was the same thing the second time, I think.
So, he, then he was
drafted, Eddie Marshall was drafted into the Army, and for a while he was away.
And he came
back and we ... at that time, and then we played together, we played (as) a trio quite
often.
And of course, Gene Cherico went to Frank Sinatra....

958
Brown:
959
 (Laughs)

960
Akiyoshi:
961
 (Laughs) And Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico both were at one time with Stan Getz, and one
day I got a call from them, somewhere, and they said, "Toshiko, you got your rhythm
section back.
"

962
Brown:
963
 (Laughs)

964
Akiyoshi:
965
 They decided to quit (laughs).

966
Brown:
967
 Well, I know Eddie Marshall, of course, being in San Francisco.
Hes a great friend and
also hes a great, great inspiration of mine.
I have my idea of what makes Eddie Marshall great;
what would you say were the hallmarks, or what was it about his style that you like?

968
Akiyoshi:
969
 Well, first of all, I think its that he has a good beat, which is very important to
me.
Sometimes its ... this is something that is ... its not mathematically.... And also,


not every drummer is for every somebody.
In other words, if a drummers great for
somebody else, it doesnt mean great for me.
Theres a certain mystical, certain things
there, and it was something you can identify, you know, together.
Eddies great part was
that hes also very open minded: hes a very intelligent man, and uh, he also, hes the first
drummer that I know--I met, that is--who played soft with the sticks.
He really had a
beautiful touch, and he was, as I said, he was very open minded, he was very susceptible
to many different things.
He still is.

970
Brown:
971
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

972
Akiyoshi:
973
 So we are very good friends, I would like to say.
You know, he said, the other
day, he was saying--I dont know how he said it--he said, "Tooo-shiko, I am getting
old" (chuckles).

974
Brown:
975
 (Laughs)

976
Akiyoshi:
977
 I dont know why he said that!

978
Brown:
979
 (Laughs) What was your impression going back to Japan, after having not been
back in four years?

980
Akiyoshi:
981
 I was very, very worried about it, because five years I was away, and I didnt
know if people would remember me or not.
And also this time, we were going back with
our original music, most of my original music, which was not done in those days in
Japan.
People always played, you know, somebody elses music or standards, things like
that.
So I had to explain about the music: explain to the point where it was easy to
understand and, you know, some kind of guide for listening.
That was ... but when we
landed at Haneda--those days, Haneda airport--and the plane was about four hours late.
But there were people waiting and I was really surprised.
You know, there was, like,
cameras and journalists were there, and a lot of fans were waiting, and I was really
surprised about that.
So, in those days, the tour was a very long dis--, that time it was
six weeks long.
And in 1963, we went back again, with the same promoter, also six
weeks.
But now, if you have a tour, so usually they say, I dont know, if you have
fourteen concerts, thats pretty, pretty long.

982
Brown:
983
 So six weeks, you mustve toured....

984
Akiyoshi:
985
 Yes.

986
Brown:
987
 ...outside of Tokyo as well?
What kind of...?

988
Akiyoshi:
989
 Every (kind of) places that you can think of, I think.


990
Brown:
991
 (Laughs) Okay.

992
Akiyoshi:
993
 And those days also, I think it was, um, union--uh, Ron (abbreviation for
Kinrsha Ongaku Kygikai, Workers Music Council) they called (it)--labor unions had
music activities.
And those were the ones that had, like, sort of like a network for going
to places, and I think that was the main, you know, outlet, yeah.

994
Brown:
995
 Because when you were talking about the scene in Japan, the jazz in scene in
Japan before you left, um, how that it was mostly centralized in (the) Tokyo area.
Now
were you able, did you go to ja-, was there a jazz scene in saka...?

996
Akiyoshi:
997
 Different places, right.

998
Brown:
999
 ...or Nara, or other places?
So you went all over Japan.

1000
Akiyoshi:
1001
 Right, yes.

1002
Brown:
1003
 So that time, by (the) sixties, there were many different clubs in different cities,
jazz clubs.

1004
Akiyoshi:
1005
 Yeah, not ... (they were) all concerts.

1006
Brown:
1007
 All concerts.

1008
Akiyoshi:
1009
 I dont think we ever played a club in those days, you know, they were all
concerts.
In sixty, 61, uh ... Art Blakey went in January--his group, (Jazz)
Messengers--and we went there in March.
So, but after that, Art Blakey, every year, he
would go to Japan, and that was the beginning of the American players going, (to) start
going to Japan.

1010
Brown:
1011
 Mm-hmm.

1012
Akiyoshi:
1013
 He was really popular in Japan.

1014
Brown:
1015
 Did you consider your tour successful?
Did your, the audience enjoy your
music?

1016
Akiyoshi:
1017
 Apparently it was successful, otherwise we would not have gone back in 63.
Excuse me.
(Goes to see about periodic beeping sound)

1018
Brown:
1019
 Is that a smoke alarm?


1020
Akiyoshi:
1021
 (Track starts in middle of sentence) ...same, six, uh, six weeks.
And that time
I stayed, because (in) 63 I was pregnant with my first child, and I was a little worried
about having a child in this country.
I wanted to be near my mother.
So after that I just
stayed, and I was due in August, so I just stayed there and had my child, which is ... now
she has her own family and own group.

1022
Brown:
1023
 Could you say her name?

1024
Akiyoshi:
1025
 Monday Michiru.

1026
Brown:
1027
 Say it again, please?

1028
Akiyoshi:
1029
 Monday Michiru, you know, like Tuesday, Monday Michiru, Tuesday...?

1030
Brown:
1031
 (Chuckles) Okay.

1032
Akiyoshi:
1033
 Thats because she was born on a Monday Michiru, so I named her Monday Michiru.
Monday Monday Michiru
is a Japanese ... Michiru is like uh, you know, tide it comes, high tide?
Thats ... its like
.. we call it michiru.
Monday Monday Michiru means something thats little and it gets fuller, so I was
hoping that she would get mature as a human being as she got older, so on, you know,
thats what....

1034
Brown:
1035
 And what was her birth date?

1036
Akiyoshi:
1037
 August 19th.

1038
Brown:
1039
 August 19th, 1963?

1040
Akiyoshi:
1041
 Yes.

1042
Brown:
1043
 Uh-huh, okay.

1044
Akiyoshi:
1045
 Im not quite sure she appreciates that (laughs)..., saying that, though!

1046
Brown:
1047
 Well, her mother gave her her birthday, so she can give her birthday, too.

1048
Akiyoshi:
1049
 No, but she is a singer and a writer, and its different than, you know I always
say its different from a musician, because they ... also, they have a different union, you
know (laughs).

1050
Brown:
1051
 Different union?
(laughs)



1052
Akiyoshi:
1053
 That proves (it)!

1054
Brown:
1055
 Its all economics.
So, um, lets go back: so in 62 you went to Japan, in 63 you
went to Japan, but in 62 also, something significant happened in your life.

1056
Akiyoshi:
1057
 Sixty-what?

1058
Brown:
1059
 62?
1962?

1060
Akiyoshi:
1061
 Two?

1062
Brown:
1063
 So you went to Japan in 61-62...?

1064
Akiyoshi:
1065
 61 and 63.

1066
Brown:
1067
 63?
So, 62 something ... this is when you played with Charles Mingus?

1068
Akiyoshi:
1069
 No, no.

1070
Brown:
1071
 No?

1072
Akiyoshi:
1073
 Playing with Charles Mingus was after I was separated from, uh....

1074
Brown:
1075
 Charlie Mariano?

1076
Akiyoshi:
1077
 ...Charlie Mariano.
So, its much later.
I, I....
It has to be after 64....

1078
Brown:
1079
 Has to be after 64?

1080
Akiyoshi:
1081
 ...because in 64 Japan had the Olympics....

1082
Brown:
1083
 Right.
I was there, too (chuckles).

1084
Akiyoshi:
1085
 So, no, I was there, uh....

1086
Brown:
1087
 Duke Ellington came, too.

1088
Akiyoshi:
1089
 Oh, yes, yes.

1090
Brown:
1091
 Yeah, I remember.


1092
Akiyoshi:
1093
 So it has to be after that.

1094
Brown:
1095
 Mm-hmm.

1096
Akiyoshi:
1097
 So the Charles Mingus....
When Charles Mingus asked me to join, I was really alone and
struggling.
Barely paying the rent.
And uh, my daughter was with my sister in Japan,
and--I think shed just started kindergarten or something, kindergarten or grammar
school, Im not quite sure.

1098
Brown:
1099
 So she was born in 63, so lets go back....

1100
Akiyoshi:
1101
 Yes.

1102
Brown:
1103
 So, for the record, make sure that, in Grove Dictionary they have it listed as 62,
that is incorrect.

1104
Akiyoshi:
1105
 Okay, now, she was born in 63, so it has to be, with Charles Mingus, it has to be after

Thats what I think.

1106
Brown:
1107
 Okay, okay.
So ... so lets go back.
In 63, you give birth to your daughter, so
you stay in Japan?

1108
Akiyoshi:
1109
 Yes.

1110
Brown:
1111
 For how long?

1112
Akiyoshi:
1113
 From there, in 64, uh, Charlie Mariano and I went to Europe for ... we had a club
engagement in Paris for four weeks, and then two weeks in each, one in Copenhagen, and
another one in Sweden, at the Golden Circle, I think it was.
In Denmark was, you know,
more (of a) market.
Then we went back to Japan again, so that ... uh, 63, and 64, thats
when the Olympics.... And I had a little project.
We had a concert, the project with....
And we were trying to get, saying this is.... Um, you know, people have....
In those
days, I thought--I still feel the same way, but--people have very poor ears.
In other
words, since printing was invented, eyesight, everything, all the information goes from
the eyes, but--I dont if thats the reason or not--but the ear has never developed.
So,
people have a difficult time understanding music, and I thought maybe I could do
something with movement.
So not dance--but it is dance--but you dont see the dancer.
It was a shadow.
So I had this project and I had a concert and it was, the screen was
behind us, and the dancer would dance behind the screen.
So thats what comes out as a
shadow, the movement.
And it would help ...
I thought that might help music for the
listener, and help them to kind of maybe understand the music.
They dont have to
understand, but appreciate, the music.
Thats what I thought, and this was something I


have done one time only.
But I think that was a pretty good idea.
But anyway, so I had
this Japanese traditional dance company, but "traditional" meaning not real traditional,
but kind of modern pro-.... Its very strange, but its not a ballet, its not a modern ballet,
but it is modern traditional dancing.
Thats kind of a funny way to say it, but there was a
dance group--it was kind of a noted group--so I asked her to participate and she was
very happy to do that.
So that was done while we had, Japan had the Olympics.
So after
that, um ..., Charlie Mariano realized that he couldnt really ... have enough activity in Japan, so
he wanted to come back to the States.
So we came back to the States at the end of 64.
It
could be 65.
I think end of 64, whatever it was.
So all that time from ... so I would say
a year in Japan.
My daughter was born in August, then it was the following year.
The
following year, I think maybe it was close to winter, possibly, because.... Now I think it
was close to winter--probably the end of 64--because I remember I knit her clothes in
yarn, so I think it was winter.

1114
Brown:
1115
 And when you came back to New York...?

1116
Akiyoshi:
1117
 We settled in, uh, New Jersey.
And shortly after that, uh, Charlie Mariano and I were
separated for private reasons.
And uh, that ... then it was very difficult, a difficult life for
me started, because if youre a jazz player, you have to travel.
You cant stay in one
place.
And I couldnt travel because my daughter was three-and-a-half, three years,
three-and-a-half years old.
Lemme see: no, one ... one-and-a-half, yeah, one-and-a-half
years old.
So ... and I didnt have enough money to have a housekeeper, because....
Jazz players, its hard to get a babysitter, because New York--as I said before--you
worked from 10 to 4 in the morning.
And there is no babysitter who will come for that
particular hour.
So you really needed a live-in and I just didnt have that kind of, you
know, funds.
I didnt have the money.
So, til today I think the most important things,
you cant solve by money; but money can solve a lot of problems (chuckles).

1118
Brown:
1119
 (Chuckles)

1120
Akiyoshi:
1121
 So unfortunately, that was ... so I think my daughter had a very, very difficult
childhood.
And then finally I decided, my immediate sister didnt have any children, and
she wanted to know if I would send her to ... send my daughter to her so she would....
And I then thought about it, and then I decided maybe I would send her.
Maybe
meanwhile, maybe I might be able to come to the point where I could get more jobs or
something.
But uh ... so she was in Japan til, uh ... first grade, beginning of first grade,
I think it was.
The beginning of her first grade, she was there.
Seven years old, it
probably was.
Yeah, three to seven years old.
But unfortunately I didnt ...
I didnt, uh
.. become like a household name.
Somehow, I mean, there were always some jobs, you
know.
I ...
I, meanwhile I had to like ... uh, I was hired to do some festival, and ... for
example, in the afternoon I was put into a trio with Elvin Jones, and then it was, uh,
Miroslav (Vitous) had just come from, uh....



1122
Brown:
1123
 Czechoslovakia.

1124
Akiyoshi:
1125
 Yeah, Czechoslovakia, hed just come and there was this ...
I dont know how
that happened, but I was hired to do things like that.
But, you know, one job, it doesnt
really support...(laughs).
But somehow I always had a little job and (its) amazing to me
when I think about it: the fact is that somehow I paid the rent.
But it never came (to)
more than that.
And even though (chuckles)--this is, I think Im kind of, sort of like a
really simple-minded person--because it never occurred to me that I could go to Berklee
and teach.
It never even occurred to me.
And thats, a lot of people did, you know, go to
teach.
And a lot of musicians teach over here at schools, too.
But um ... (chuckles) so I
think Im pretty simple-minded, the fact that I, and its amazing, the fact that it never
even occurred to me (laughs).

1126
Brown:
1127
 Maybe it wasnt something you were interested in.

1128
Akiyoshi:
1129
 Probably not.
And sometimes Japanese journalists, jazz journalists, said,
You could come back to Japan, and youd be a star!
" And that didnt even occur to me,
either, you know!

1130
Brown:
1131
 So I guess it was during this time then that you did play with Charles Mingus.
Is
that correct?

1132
Akiyoshi:
1133
 Yes.
I was just playing solo at the ... the solo started as a ... actually, I was
going to have a day job, because, you know, children dont grow younger, they get older,
and need, uh ... need the funds to raise them.
And my prospects as a jazz player werent
that great, so I thought, "Well, I probably need a day job.
" So I paid $100 to init-- for a
computer programming school.
It was four months at a time, and I was in the middle of
it, so I had to wait for the time when they started a new one (term).
And, meanwhile, I
went to the Jazz Gallery, the Five Spot, you know, its in ... and there were Joe Termini and Iggy
Termini, who were the owners, brothers.
And Joe Termini came up to me and said, "Do you feel
like playing solo?
" And he said, "I just cant afford to have two bands anymore, two
groups anymore, and if you play solo maybe you can play intermission here.
" Thats
how I was saved and I didnt go to computer school.

1134
Brown:
1135
 (Chuckles) Thank goodness!

1136
Akiyoshi:
1137
 (Chuckling) I think about it, I say, probably the Buddha said, "Dont go, Ill
get you some job.
" So this job, it was a long time.
Then when finally the Five Spot
closed, Art DLugoff of the Gate, Top of the Gate, you know, Village Gate, and Top of
the Gate was used most of the time was (for) trio jobs.
And so Art D'Lugoff said, "Come play at
my place," so I was playing solo there, also.
In those times, John Lewis used to come in


and I didnt even know John was there, you know, but he used to come in to, I dont
know, listen to ... well, he used to come in, but anyway....
So, when I was doing that,
Charles Mingus came to me and said, "Why dont you join my group?
" And uh ... before that, I
must mention about John Lewis, though, because this probably ... Im not quite sure, Im
kind of a little bit mixed up as far as that is concerned.
Charles Mingus asked me ... could be,
that could be first.... Um, "Why dont you join my group?
" And I said, "Why?
There
are so many good players," and he said, "Its true that there are a lot of good players, but
youre a new name," he said, "Youre a new name, and a new name is very important to
the group.
" Now, that really impressed me, because Charles Mingus, he couldve said to me,
Its good for you, youll get recognition," which I did.
Uh, "many people will notice
you," and like this.
He couldve said that to me, but he didn't.
You know, he was ...
many people, I think, disregard that part of Charles Mingus, you know.
They always ... its more
fun to talk about the other part of Charles Mingus (laughs), so probably thats what they always
talk about.
But he was like that.
So I joined the group and then was ... that was kind of
an interesting experience, the fact is, because ... for several reasons.
One--I think I
mentioned yesterday--he rehearsed, the rehearsal was at his apartment.
And uh, he
didnt have any music: he sang and we all had to learn that.
I think thats the best way.
But it was a small group, and so on.
And, when I joined, immediately we had (a gig at)
Peps in Philadelphia.
Peps was around the corner from the Showboat where I used to
play with a trio, but Peps was a bigger club, you know.
And ...
I think Pepper Adams
was playing; and uh, there was a trombone player--Im trying to think--it could be
Garnett Brown, I dont quite remember.
It could be Garnett Brown, I dont know.
But one point
.. when I first had joined, there was Booker Ervin.
I used to call him "Long John
Silver," because he looked like Robert Newton (laughs).
So ... and Richard Williams was
on trumpet.
So when we went there ... so we were there two weeks.
Two weeks ... the
front line changed, you know.
So the second week, <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1888_179">Charles Mingus</span> would say, "The next
weekend, Count Basie band comes, and we gotta, so we really have to rehearse.
" So we were
rehearsing many tunes, and so they came for a couple days, the weekend that Count Basie
band was there, and we ... he never played the ones we rehearsed (laughs).

1138
Brown:
1139
 (Laughs)

1140
Akiyoshi:
1141
 It was really, kind of like that.
And uh ... then at some point, we were at the
Newport festival, but not in Newport, it was Cliff Manor, I think it was called.
Cliff, uh
.. it was more like a protest....

1142
Brown:
1143
 The alternate festival.

1144
Akiyoshi:
1145
 Yes, it was a little ... out at that place.
I think it was something like that.
And
uh ... we also, there was twice--I have a picture--so we played at Newport up front, on
the main stage, but maybe another year, probably, we played the protest place.
But the
one that I have (chuckles), the one photo was I was playing the bass.
And he had a tune


called "Eat That Chicken," and its in A-flat.
And (sings), "eat that chicken, eat that
chicken, eat that chicken now," and he always played piano on that one.
He wanted me
to play the bass.
So (laughs), we were doing that and somebody took a photo and it was
at Newport.
So I remember that.
We did one year, one year we were playing the main
Newport, another year it was the other place, and I dont quite remember when was
when.
Somebody was writing a Charles Mingus book, and he kind of reminded me I was there
two different times with Charles Mingus.
So I guess hes probably accurate, I dont quite
remem--.
But at one point it was a quintet--this one for quite a long time was a
quintet--Larry, uh, Lonnie Hillyer Hillyer, I think, Hillyer....

1146
Brown:
1147
 Oh, Hillyer, yeah.

1148
Akiyoshi:
1149
 ...uh, the ... uh, Charles McPherson.

1150
Brown:
1151
 Oh, Charles McPherson.

1152
Akiyoshi:
1153
 Yes.
He was such a sweet man!
Hes the one and uh ... Charlie Charles McPherson.
So those two were the quintet.
And this one (Mingus) kept quite a long time as a quintet.

1154
Brown:
1155
 And of course, Dannie Richmond on drums?

1156
Akiyoshi:
1157
 Hmm?

1158
Brown:
1159
 Dannie Richmond on drums?

1160
Akiyoshi:
1161
 Dannie Richmond was, but ... see, those days, when you had a drug (arrest)
record, you couldnt play Philadelphia.
So Dannie Richmond couldnt play Philadelphia, he would
have somebody else, and ...
I dont quite remember who he had, but.... Charles Mingus and
Dannie Richmond were more like they were a couple: theyd go so well together, they
could change the rhythm pattern and so on together, and so.... And Dannie was a very
nice man.
He was a really nice man, and Lew Tabackin had some trips (with him) in Canada, a
couple times, together.
But he loved duck, and I cooked the duck here sometimes.
He a
really nice man, though, but that was Dannie Richmond.
I just uh ...
I couldnt stop
missing my music, so I quit.

1162
Brown:
1163
 So what year was that?
What, what time period?

1164
Akiyoshi:
1165
 Im trying to think what year it was, because after I quit a white lady was the
pianist, but then Charles Mingus called me and wanted me to come back.
And maybe it was
because, he said, "I have a concert," you know, "I have a recording," I mean, "I have a
recording.
" And uh ... "So I want you to come back.
" And this was ... the first intention
was to record at the Five Spot, then it got ... it was a tuba player--I forgot his name, he


usually played at the Radio City Orchestra.
Um, I dont think he was a jazz player.
But
anyway, a tuba player.
Then, you know, the next thing, it gets bigger, bigger, bigger, and
the next thing you know its a Town Hall concert.
And you have everything: two drums,
two guitars, two pianos (chuckles).
Snooky Young was the lead trumpet player, and we
were rehearsing from 12 oclock.
And the music was not ready (chuckles)!
And it was
already four in the morning, back to the elevator going up, Snooky Young looked so insecure,
What is going to happen!
" you know (laughs).
That was the famous, famous....

1166
Brown:
1167
 Album ().

1168
Akiyoshi:
1169
 Concert.

1170
Brown:
1171
 Sure.
So for the larger ensemble, how did Charles Mingus, did he still recite all the parts
to everybody?
Or did he write any charts...?

1172
Akiyoshi:
1173
 No, he never did.

1174
Brown:
1175
 Never did.

1176
Akiyoshi:
1177
 But the Town Hall concert, yes.
Town Hall concert (October 12, 1962), it was
at the rehearsal, there was an arranger.
And I remember one arranger was (Gene Roland)
.. he used to play what they call "peck horn" (alto horn), and he wrote like it was
arranged for ... the Kenton band or something.
Anyway, he arranged, he did not write.
He said, "Thats not what I told him to ... orchestrate," he said, "Cost me $500 and he
doesnt come up (with it)," blah, blah, blah, and there were things like that.
But uh, it
was a really ... no music was prepared.
So when we were at the Town Hall (and it)
opened, there were copyists there--I dont know if youve heard from other people--
there were copyists in the middle of the stage.
And Charles Mingus said, "Well, this is a
recording session.
If anybody has heard its a concert, you should get your money back.
"
So everybody was trying to get their money back, and then the mob police had to come
out (chuckles), in the street.
And it was ... but Charles Mingus strongest point was he would, at
that particular spot, even if it was a concert, he would sing what to do.
You know, like
say, "Whap!
" so on, so on.
Hes playing and he said, "Whap!
" and he sang and that is
what the trumpet player had to do, and so on.
He came up at an instant, uh, phrase, he
would come up with something for the musicians to play.
And that was, he was at (his)
best.
It was really, you know, he was really a special ...
I think really special ...
probably you could call (him) a genius.
He was like, (in) an instant he could come up
with....
He could make music very exciting.
So ... thats something like a ...
I always
felt like his music reminded me of Mexican painting, you know: very colorful, very
strong.

1178
Brown:
1179
 Do you feel like you were influenced by...?


1180
Akiyoshi:
1181
 Oh, definitely.
I think I was influenced by him quite a lot.

1182
Brown:
1183
 And did you have a good personal relationship with him?

1184
Akiyoshi:
1185
 I like to think so, yes, yes.
Somebody tried to say, somebody said that
Charles Mingus, uh ... put the lid of the piano over my hand.
He never did that.
If he did that I
probably wouldnt have a hand (laughs).
You know, people come up with all kinds of
stupid lies.
He wasnt ... but he was very nasty to other players.
You know, sometimes
if he didnt like (something or someone), hed kick the drums and things like that
laughs).
So, he had two different personalities.

1186
Brown:
1187
 Maybe nowadays they would say he was bipolar.
But who knows?
I dont
know, but we know that he died from Lou Gehrigs disease.

1188
Akiyoshi:
1189
 Oh, really?
I didnt know that.

1190
Brown:
1191
 Charles Mingus?

1192
Akiyoshi:
1193
 Huh?

1194
Brown:
1195
 He died from Lou Gehrigs disease?

1196
Akiyoshi:
1197
 Oh, Lou Gehrigs disease?
I didnt know.
You know, he used to have like a
big bump in the arm....

1198
Brown:
1199
 Oh.

1200
Akiyoshi:
1201
 ... and he was in the hospital--uh, Mount Sinai--and I went to see him.
And
he was so big.
He was walking from there, so big that he looked almost feminine.
And
uh, uh ... it was some kind of lump, real big lump, and um....

1202
Brown:
1203
 On both arms?

1204
Akiyoshi:
1205
 No, on one arm.

1206
Brown:
1207
 One arm.

1208
Akiyoshi:
1209
 One arm.
I didnt know what it was....
When I had my very first Town Hall
concert)--first and only--that is, 67.
1956, when I came to this country--I think I
mentioned that--in 1966 I was, as I said, I was barely paying the rent, and 66, uh, New
Years ... the Japanese always think of New Years Day, you get introspective, you


know.
"What did I do?
Ive been in this country for ten years.
What did I do?
I didnt
do anything.
Maybe I will have a concert," you know, "maybe Ill have a concert;
maybe people might notice if I have a concert.
" So it took me a year to prepare,
basically, the funds.
And at that time someone asked me if I would do ... uh, the Holiday
Inn circuit, it was hotel lounges.
And uh ... so I ...
I went to this--I had to do an
audition--to this apartment and an old man was there and there was a piano.
And I
played and he said, "Oh, youre a jazz player!
" And I said, "I dont sing," so--those
places, of course, you sing--but I dont sing, so I dont know.
But he said, "Oh, its fine,
fine.
But you just have to play a lot of arpeggios!
" (laughs) Said, "You have to play that
arpeggio!
" So anyway, I got the job.
It was ... the greatest thing about the job, I was
getting $200 a week, but no overhead: hotel and food were paid (for).
And I didnt have
my apartment, I was still staying at a hotel here, so I didnt have that either.
So there was
no overhead.
And it was ... very soon I had about $3000 and I was.... Those days, a
house, you could buy a house for $15,000.
And it was six months later, I was thinking,
Gee, if I gig for another six months, I may be able to buy a house.
" But I didnt do that,
anyway (laughs).

1210
Brown:
1211
 (Laughs)

1212
Akiyoshi:
1213
 I needed about $3000 those days to--isnt that something?
So cheap, you
cant think of it today--the Town Hall concert.
And that was a self-produced concert.
Then it took me a year to prepare.
And ... then, uh, that time the mayor was (John)
Lindsay, that was the mayor.
And for some reason, he named that particular day
October 7, 1967) as the "Jazz Day" of New York.
Now, that's my luck!
My God!
You
know, as I said, I prepared from a year before.
And about a couple months before,
whatever it is, and he said it its "Jazz (Day).
" So they had like a black-tie, invitation-
only kind of jazz concert at the Metropolitan (Museum of Art).
Then there was a free
concert at Central Park, things like that.
And ... (gasps) ... all the jazz critics, of course,
came to my concert.
And also Mingus came to my concert, with a camera.
I thought that
was a really, you know, great gesture.
And thanks to Little Little John Wilson, he wrote a really
good review.
But ... it didnt do anything!
It didnt do any good.
After that, I was still
barely paying the rent!
(laughs)

1214
Brown:
1215
 Did you have good attendance, though?

1216
Akiyoshi:
1217
 I wont say that.
Maybe half?
Uh, because there was ...
I had to sell.... See,
this is interesting: I had a friend who used to with Martha Graham dance company, a
Japanese woman, and she said, "Well, you know, you can do it.
Its a little hard, but if
you just go to a Japanese company and bow, then they will buy tickets," and so on.
In
those days, there were not that many companies.
But I would have to go from one
company to another, they would buy five tickets here, three tickets here.
That took like
.. most of the companies, they only had offices only.
Not like today, you know; today


its like poo!--I can sell 250 tickets in one company (chuckles).
But it was like this, so I
had to go from ... 9 in the morning to 5, usually about three companies I could cover in a
day.
Then, from 4 oclock I would write.
And from ... almost six in the morning, I
would write.
I had five music (charts) to write, for the big band, that is.
So, that was like
.. probably that was the hardest, and uh ... when I finished the concert, I was like whew,
like really, because I dont think I could do that today (chuckles).

1218
Brown:
1219
 (Laughs) (Phone rings, plays Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens Fifth Symphony) I guess its a good
time to take a break!
I guess you really do love Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven!
So Toshiko-san, also
significant about the Town Hall concert is you meet Lew Tabackin, yes?

1220
Akiyoshi:
1221
 (Inhales) Yes.
That, that was kind of funny in a sense, because I was looking
for a tenor player.
As I said before, I was preparing for the whole year.
Now ... uh,
Clark Terry had a big band in those days, and they used to play, uh ...
I think it was every
weekend, at the Half Note (which) used to be on Spring Street.
Half Note was Spring
Street.
There was a piano player, the pianist was Don Friedman.
But Don Friedman got some job
in Queens somewhere, it was some place where, kind of, long term or something.
So the
manager of Clarks band at that time, his name was Bob Messenger.
And he called me,
he said, "Well, Don Friedman cannot make it.
Can you sit in?
" So I was subbing, I said, "Well, it
may be interesting to read the music, but I havent read music for a long time.
" So, okay,
I went there.
And ... if you know the Half Note, the middle was the bar, a circular bar,
and the band was upstairs.
Now, the room was two, divided in two, one side and another
side.
Then when the big band went on the top, the rhythm section was on this side, the
horn players were kind of spread, so to speak.
So, I was there, and Clark Terry started with a
D-flat blues or something like that.
So I had to play (mumbles), then Clark Terry played
something, then it was, I heard a tenor player play, and it was, boy, that like knocked me
out!
It was an interesting combination: were talking about this, like 67, you know.
And
.. it had Lucky Thompsons family tree, which was very rare to hear in those days--I
guess it still is today.
But what he played was like a semi-cross between John Coltrane and
Sonny Rollins....

1222
Brown:
1223
 (Laughs)

1224
Akiyoshi:
1225
 ...you know, a cross between that (mimics sound).
"Why that?
Who could
that be?
" (mimics sound again).
So, make the story short, that was Lew Tabackin, and thats the
first time I met him, and then I said, "I want to cop him for my concert.
" And he sorta
agreed, but ... there was, Thad (Jones) and Mel (Lew Tabackinis)s band had a swing tour in
California, and Lew Tabackin was asked to go.
I think it was, that time I think it was somebody
else who couldnt go or something, because Lew Tabackin wasnt really a member.
So of course,
naturally, three weeks against one job, he went there, so he didnt play my concert
laughs), he didnt play my concert.
But thats how I met him.
Then, uh, I would have
some, periodically I would have some jobs, for example, Hartford had a jazz society, and


they asked me to come and play, and with a horn player.
So that was the first time,
actually this was the first time we played together, quartet.
And ... so, Jake, he was, Jake
Hanna was living in New York at that time and he didnt have anything, so he said, "I
think Im gonna come listen to you.
" So he was coming with us, and Lew Tabackin was with
somebody else--you had to take a ... you have to drive there, so on.
So as I said, I didnt
know him, Id just met him, so I was kind of a little cocky, and I said (chuckles), I said,
you know, "Ill play trio for a few numbers, then I will announce you and Ill bring (you)
over, so you play," you know (laughs).
So, okay, so I played, then I (said), "Lew
Tabackin," and he played tenor--he really, he played a long solo.
He still does, but he
really ... what he played, it knocked me out!
Then he started taking (out) the flute, and I
said to myself, "Oh my God," because most great saxophone players play terrible flute.
So I thought, "Oh my God, Im going to hear some terrible, sad flute" (laughs).

1226
Brown:
1227
 (Laughs)

1228
Akiyoshi:
1229
 They said it was "Willow Weep for Me," and it was like his ... as you know,
his flute, you know, hes got a beautiful sound....

1230
Brown:
1231
 Hes actually providing the soundtrack for your oral history right now!
(laughs)

1232
Akiyoshi:
1233
 (Laughs) Its a beautiful sound, and that was a real surprise for me, I said,
Wow!
" So thats how I met (Lew) and we played together.
Since then, if I have
something, you know, a quartet situation, I always asked him, because he was free-lance
and also he was, he had one leg in the studio.
And he was with, uh ... Clark Terry
band.
And Clark Terry band, this was the one--I think they went somewhere, either
North Carolina or Georgia, one of those places--and they met at midnight at a bar, uh,
something Street, its moved up, uh, what do you call, famous, I think....
The bus
there, everybody took that, and they drove all night to get to one concert and then came
back.
I think there was very little money.
And uh ... those were the days.
You couldnt
do that today (laughs).
But I remember that he was usually with Clarks (band).
And I
used to be, became a regular sub; for example, Clark Terry had a job in Baron, Club Baron,
which was in Harlem--uh, it couldve been 130th and Lennox, it couldve been 135 and
Lennox, Im not quite sure--that was around there.
They used to have a place called
Smalls Paradise and I played there a couple times with Marianos quartet.
But this was
in) much later years and Clark Terry had a ... played at the Club Baron.
This was also, the
stage was upstairs, you know (chuckles), but whats interesting, those days, really,
because you see the same faces, you know, two, three times a week.
I think a drink was
somewhere like 80 cents or so, and there was no cover charge or anything.
And they
would tell you, said, "Well, you sound good tonight!
" or they said, "You sounded better
last night!
"

1234
Brown:
1235
 (Laughs)



1236
Akiyoshi:
1237
 (Laughs) And it was like ... it was ... you cant, you dont have that today,
you know.
You dont have that kind of rapport.
First of all, going one time to a jazz club
today, you are looking at, two people, you are looking at close to $100.
So, things like
that ... its something that you go to listen to some group that you like, and one time.
You know, you dont keep going for two or three times.
You cant ... economically, its
not feasible.
So it was a very different scene in those days from today.
Anyways ...
when I started going with Lew Tabackin, and we decided to get married, at that time Lew Tabackin was
working with The Tonight Show band.

1238
Brown:
1239
 Yep.
That year was 1969?
That correct?

1240
Akiyoshi:
1241
 Uh, 69, 70.

1242
Brown:
1243
 Okay.

1244
Akiyoshi:
1245
 70, no, no, 70, 71, around then.

1246
Brown:
1247
 Thats when you got...?

1248
Akiyoshi:
1249
 Because he had ... Doc Severinsen had a small band to go up, so he was a
member of that, had like six singers or something, that kind of thing.
And uh, and then
they moved to Los Angeles.
So that brought us to move to Los Angeles, 72, summer.
And, at that time I decided I was going to quit because I, because ...
I didnt really make
any impact, you know.
I tried hard, I had my concert, got a good review and everything,
but it didnt really change my life.
And uh ... so I decided maybe I should quit, because
the world doesnt need another piano player, you know (chuckles).

1250
Brown:
1251
 But, but, Toshiko-san, didnt you go to Japan again, for Expo 1970, before you
went to move to Los Angeles?

1252
Akiyoshi:
1253
 Oh yes, the 1970 Expo (in saka), there was, the music director, the name was
Misa Watanabe, and <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_2158_1525726">Watanabe Productions</span>, very big production (company), and she ...
that (was) more like a real pops--you know, what Japanese call "talent" (tarento),
because television and blah, blah, blah kind of things.
She always said, "I respect (what)
you do, but its not, you know, not for my production.
" So when she was assigned to be
music director of the festival, and she called me up, she said, you know, "I can have you
for this," so this is good.
Thats how I was invited, for quartet.
And that time there was a
group (that) came from France, too, uh, Daniel Humair, I remember, he was the drummer
at that time, uh, came to Ja... saka, you know, World Fair.
And uh, I had Lew Tabackin, myself,
Mickey Roker, and Lew Tabackins very good friend called, um, Bob Daugherty, Bob Daugherty, Bob Daugherty ...
I will think (of
it) in a minute.


1254
Brown:
1255
 Bass?
On bass?

1256
Akiyoshi:
1257
 Yes, bass.

1258
Brown:
1259
 Bob Cranshaw?

1260
Akiyoshi:
1261
 No, no, hes very active, but this man is ... more or less stopped playing, uh, I
would think.
But, the four of us.
And we just went for ...
I dont think hes a very noted
person.
Um, I will ask Lew Tabackin.

1262
Brown:
1263
 Not Bob Hurst, though.

1264
Akiyoshi:
1265
 Huh?

1266
Brown:
1267
 Bob Hurst?

1268
Akiyoshi:
1269
 No, no.

1270
Brown:
1271
 Bobs too young.

1272
Akiyoshi:
1273
 No, it isnt, no.
Bob Daugherty!
Bob Daugherty.

1274
Brown:
1275
 Bob Daugherty, uh huh, okay.

1276
Akiyoshi:
1277
 Bob Daugherty , Bob Daugherty, and he was the one.
He was kind of a friend
of Lew Tabackin and so on.
So we were there just for the, that fair, world fair.

1278
Brown:
1279
 One event?

1280
Akiyoshi:
1281
 No, I think we played maybe three days or something like that.
I dont quite
remember.
But it wasnt one ... but just in and out for that, we didnt have any tour or
anything.
So that was 70.
And ... that was the first time Lew Tabackin had been in Japan, and for
a very hot August, summer.
Very, very hot and very unpleasant.

1282
Brown:
1283
 (Chuckles)

1284
Akiyoshi:
1285
 So, anyway.
So that was the first ... and then, as I said, it was 72, he ... and
uh....
I was, as I said, I was going to quit, I decided.
So I burned everything: my folder
for the PR, you know, things like that, they were union things.
I burned everything and I
decided....



1286
Brown:
1287
 (Incredulous) You said you burned everything?

1288
Akiyoshi:
1289
 Yeah, so, I was going to quit.
So dah, dah, dah, so we left--you know, my
child, she was at the second grade by that time--anyway, we moved (in) July 72.
And
we were staying at Leonard Feather home til I found some, we found some apartment
or so on.
And uh, we found a house in nearby Burbank, where he had to go (to) work,
because he doesnt drive and I had to take him, so it had to be near Burbank....

1290
Brown:
1291
 Lew Tabackin doesnt drive?

1292
Akiyoshi:
1293
 No, he doesnt.
He doesnt drive, so Im the driver (laughs).
Anyway, then,
shortly after we moved, Jimmy Lyons, who was a producer at that time at the....

1294
Brown:
1295
 Monterey (Jazz Festival).

1296
Akiyoshi:
1297
 Monterey, and he called me, said, "John Lewis wants you to be in part of a piano
playhouse.
" And uh, because John Lewis was the director at that time, the music
director.
And that kept me ... stopped me from ... quitting.
So I had a few times like
that before, because Joe Termini offered me (a job) to play solo, so this was ... John Lewis
offered me the playhouse.
That time it was Billy Taylor, John Lewis, and Erskine
Hawkins, and myself.
There was that ... and I, this was the first time I played Monterey.
Id never played Monterey before.
So that saved my career, so to speak, and John Lewis was....
So anyway, he was a very important person in my life, and I didnt know him then, not
much, but he used to come to--I think I mentioned before--when I was a soloist at the
Top of the Gate, he used to come around quite often.
But I just said "Hello," and thats
about all.
So I got to know him after that, and found out he loves wine and, you know,
and I collect wine.
So, he became a very good friend.
His wife Mirjana Lewis is an
accomplished, a very accomplished harpsichord player, and uh, also a wonderful cook.
So Lew Tabackin and I would go to their home, or they would come to our house, and so on, and
became very, very good friends.
But he was really ... little things like that kept me alive.
He used to say, he said, um, "When people identify with your music, you should always
play it.
You should always play it.
" And he said, "In my case, I think its Django.
"
Thats what he said.
So he said that he always played "Django.
" So, my case, it was
Long Yellow Road," I guess.
So ... in Japan, they always say, if I dont play that, some
fan will say, "I dont feel like I heard you," so they kinda expect me to play that.
So I
always play that.
Lew Tabackin calls it my signature tune.
But John Lewis was really helpful to me.
And one time he said, uh, "You know, why dont you write a tenor lead?
" cause he
played, when we were there he played a record, it was Coleman Hawkins playing the
lead.
I dont quite remember the music, though, tune, but....
So I had a couple of music
pieces) that were tenor leads, and uh, so that was a little bit different, you know, gives a
different color, so to speak.
So ...
I think I was also very much influenced by--because
when I used to listen to Modern Jazz Quartet, when it came out, first came out when I


was still in Japan--he was still playing standards.
The first one (The Quartet, Savoy MG
 had "All the Things You Are," things like that, it was very different, and nothing
like ... you know, I mentioned before, I was into Bud Powell, and this was like totally
different.
And it was so European and I felt like ... (sighs) "Maybe this man would like
to become a European.
"

1298
Brown:
1299
 (Chuckles)

1300
Akiyoshi:
1301
 So ... after we became very good friends, Lew Tabackin and I had our twenty-fifth
anniversary, and I figured, "Well, we wont have a fiftieth anniversary, so maybe well
have a big party.
" So we had a party at the Essex House, and invited a few people, and
so on, and of course, John Lewis and his wife.
And on occasions like that, people make a
speech, you know.
And so John Lewis stood up and he said, "Toshiko infused, employed,
infused Japanese culture, so I dont have to do it.
" And he said that.
And then I, thats
when I realized, thats what hed been trying to do.
Because everybody knows jazz is a
fusion between European and African culture, born in this country, but he really wanted
to have more universality, I mean, more European culture into.... Of course, his wife
came from uh, the uh, now its gone ... uh, what do you call, separated in two....

1302
Brown:
1303
 Yugoslavia?

1304
Akiyoshi:
1305
 Yugoslavia.
So things like that had a lot to do with it.
But also his music, you
know, he was ... more, becoming more, more and more like a universal (??
), so on.
I
realized my thinking was so shallow, and so....
He really um ... highly ... thought of me
as, some of the music that I have, like "Kogun," for example, or "Minamata".... You
know, he actually used "Kogun" as material, teaching material at Harvard when he was
teaching (in the) summer.
I have nothing but fond memories, and then I have ... today,
you know, I have, I like to have two sides: I still have, heavily, I have a lot of influence
from Bud Powell, I think I do--but I probably dont play like (as well as) him--but also I
have a lot of influence from John Lewis, the fact (is), I like to have both.
John Lewis was a very
economized player, meaning each note has meaning, has a heavy, heavy weight, a lot of
weight, and thats something I would like to be able to do.
So I like to have both sides.
So hes been a very good ... uh, teacher, in a sense, so.... Ive been very, I think lucky.
The fact is I came to this country when the music scene was still very open.
Not like
productions are like today, so you could sit in, if you know the tune, you could sit in, and
most of the tunes I knew.
So, thats the best lesson you can get, you know, playing with
great players.
And they were very nice to me and very supportive.
I came at a very good
time, and I think that is my asset.

1306
Brown:
1307
 Well, you brought up two very important, uh, uh, things that we should try to
discuss in more detail.
One is influence, you know, what you were saying is, looking at
cultural influences in music....



1308
Akiyoshi:
1309
 Yes.

1310
Brown:
1311
 ...and then also looking at the formation of your first orchestra.
So....

1312
Akiyoshi:
1313
 Oh?

1314
Brown:
1315
 Your first big band, the formation, the creation of your first big band.

1316
Akiyoshi:
1317
 Yes.

1318
Brown:
1319
 How did that come about?
We know that you are now in Los Angeles....

1320
Akiyoshi:
1321
 So, we moved to Los Angeles because of Lews job, in 72, summer.
And Los
Angeles had not much activity there.
You know, I remember Hampton Hawes used to,
we ... shortly after that, Hamp invited us to their home and his wife made a ...
I think I
never had a great taco like that in my life!
Anyway, so he was very, actually,
complaining a bit about the fact that the jazz clubs--for example, there was Dantes in
North Hollywood--but they were more like outlets for studio players, you know.
So he
was pretty much complaining the fact that they werent hiring real jazz players, whose
livelihood depended on playing.
And uh, that place was more like an outlet for studio
players, so that they could play a little bit or something like that.
So, not much (of a) jazz
scene.
Then Lew Tabackin found out, uh, he was asked, there was a union (that( had a rehearsal
room, and uh, he was asked to ... most of the time those rehearsals were done by the
writers who were trying to get into studios or movie thing or so on, to try out some of the
music.
I think thats what it was.
But ...
I forgot to mention the fact, after the Town Hall
concert, I felt very comfortable, I thought Id like to write for the big band because ...
I
could express more, then, because you have more color, so on.
But there wasnt any
place that--at that time the union in New York didnt have any room; today they do, but
they didnt--and uh, the rehearsal done by (for) this Town Hall concert, for example, the
cheapest place you could get was $30 an hour and you needed three hours and so on.
So,
once you start a band--I really thought, "I wish I could start a band"--but once you start,
you have to keep it, and I really didnt have that kind of money.
So that was that.
So
when we moved to Los Angeles, I wasnt, I had forgotten all about this, and then Lew Tabackin
came home one day and said, "I know you havent written but about five music
compositions)," which was for the Town Hall, and "Maybe Ill get the musicians, so
maybe well play your music," you know.
It was something to do; so he was very
frustrated with not much jazz scene, so I think he wanted to be close to that.
So ... those
days, 50 cents for two hours and 45 minutes at the union.
Now its $5.00 (chuckles).

1322
Brown:
1323
 (Chuckling) Fifty cents!


1324
Akiyoshi:
1325
 But 50 cents, so I said, "Well, thats, we can afford it.
" Thats how it started
in 1973, spring.
And he got all the musicians, and it was a ... took about six months to
settle down.
Some musicians didnt want to put up with the music; some musicians, I
didnt think were appropriate, you know, so on, blah, blah, blah.
So thats how the band
started, not as a working band.
It was just to get together and so on, and I thought if I
could probably develop my repertoire and I was kind of getting my, more and more ...
its kind of hard to explain, because you dont really come to a conclusion overnight, you
know.
Sleep and then it was, "Yeah, thats what Im going to do," no.
But the many,
many years I kind of felt like I really wanted to express, maybe, a point of view, my point
of view, not just ... theres a tune and you improvise on (it), you know, having a good
time, nothing like that.
But thats--nothing wrong with it--but I wanted to ... my point
of view, for example, because Im very interested and Im very ... susceptible to social
issues.
Which is, most of the time, social conditions many times were dictated or geared
by government policy.
So, all those things have always been part of my interest, and I
wanted to ... see, Id like to think this one is, I think this way.
If I were a writer, I would
write in words, but because Im a jazz musician, so I like to spell it out in jazz music.
So,
I would start thinking like that, you know, and....
So when Lew Tabackin suggested we do that,
and then I thought this was a good opportunity for me to ... so meanwhile--this was
-Im sorry, 73.
And in 73 we started, and uh ... going every Wednesday morning
from 10:15 to.... And doing this, I accumulated a little at a time, the music and so on.
And they were coming, everyone ... and I started thinking, "Ive got to give them
something.
Theyre giving me, you know, to play my music," so I thought maybe Id....
I knew some recording producer in Japan--basically he was a classical recording
producer--but he was a good friend of mine.
So I wrote and said this was happening and
would he be interested in recording.
So he said he would be interested in recording.
So
in 1974, I think, Duke Ellington died.

1326
Brown:
1327
 Mm-hmm.

1328
Akiyoshi:
1329
 And uh, after Duke Ellington died, broom-broom-broom....

1330
Brown:
1331
 Harry Carney died, everybody (chuckles).

1332
Akiyoshi:
1333
 It was like following him, so to speak, like that.
And uh, Nat Hentoff had
written sort of a memoir or memories of Duke Ellington in, I think it was Village Voice, and uh,
when I read that and it.... You know, sometimes the little things have to be triggers and
he was talking about how Duke Ellington was, how proud Duke Ellington was of being a black American,
and his music (was) based on his race, a lot of em, you know: "Black Butterfly," what
have you, "Black and Beige (Tan) Fantasy," so on, blah, blah, blah.
And even (if) you
know it, still somebody said that.
And that triggered me to, I should look (at) my
heritage, cause um ... the normal belief in Japan was, to be Japanese and play jazz was a
handicap.
Thats the way, that was the normal thinking.
And uh, I was thinking, I said,


so when I read it I said, "Well, Im a jazz player; Ive been playing since I was sixteen
years old, and so on, blah, blah.
Im not a bad player, I have probably more experience
than a lot of young American players, but I have a different heritage.
" And uh, "I look at
my heritage as my asset rather than my handicap, and maybe I can bring something into
jazz tradition," which it was, Japanese culture never was part of that.
Maybe I could try
to infuse something; maybe that would be my job.
So, thats what triggered me, and at
the same time, there was a Japanese soldier was discovered in the Philippine jungle.
It
was nearly thirty years, he didnt know the war was ended.
In fact, I think he has written
a book--its a very interesting book.
But anyway--Lt. Onoda, Second Lieutenant Onoda
Hiro)--and I was writing for the flute piece.
I needed a flute piece for the recording.
And uh, and also at the same time, my father was a student of n play--I think I
mentioned that earlier--and he used to, also he was a student of tsuzumi, which is a
Japanese four-headed (drum).
And I always liked the sound, you know.
Actually, I like
all drums, I guess, but I really liked that sound, and I was thinking itd be really nice to
use that, you know.
So I thought Id like to use that, maybe it would be great with the
flute, and ... so I had a tape sent from Japan.
This was like a demonstration tape, a
demonstration tape for the tsuzumi playing.
And they have all kinds of ways of playing;
this was the Kanze (-ry) style of playing (chuckles).

1334
Brown:
1335
 (Chuckles)

1336
Akiyoshi:
1337
 N players, you know, so they showed....
I took ...
It took me ... boy, ten
years to put them together in one segment, so that would be ... and it was music, fit to the
music, where they fall and so on.
And that was "Kogun," came as "Kogun.
" And when I
did that and we recorded this on eight-track....

1338
Brown:
1339
 A-track (chuckles).

1340
Akiyoshi:
1341
 Eight-track.
Very low budget and eight-track, and in a place called Sage &
Sound Studio, in Hollywood, that was nearby (chuckles).
Anyway, uh ... when I wrote
this one and on the way through we did, I thought it was ... Japan, they were gonna put
me down, you know, they were really gonna.... Because Japanese jazz fans, they want,
more of purist (approach).
One, they like small groups--I dont blame them, I feel (the)
same way (chuckles).
And, two, they dont like, you know, theyre purists, they like ...
something like that--Japanese, you know, drums or what have you--"whats this?!
" you
know.
They, I thought they were really gonna put me down, and I thought, "Well, go
ahead and put me down.
I dont really care.
" So thats what I ... and that became an all-
time seller.
My records never sold (laughing) til that time!

1342
Brown:
1343
 (Chuckles)

1344
Akiyoshi:
1345
 One and, this one was a big band!
One, two, thats something that no one had


ever done before, and no one ever heard something like that.
And both (were) against,
you know, sales, but it became (an) all-time seller.
The first sale was, I think, it was
000.
So, you know, jazz in those days, if you sold 5,000, it was considered good.

1346
Brown:
1347
 Still today (laughs).

1348
Akiyoshi:
1349
 So (chuckles) ... so that was--and I was really surprised, wow!--so that was
my milestone.

1350
Brown:
1351
 1974, Kogun, mm-hmm.

1352
Akiyoshi:
1353
 And I thought, "I wish Duke Ellington were alive.
I wonder what he would say?
" I was
thinking about that.
Duke Ellington was always very uh, ... grandeur.
He came a couple of times
to the (Berklee) school when I was at school, and I had a terrible cold.
And he would say
deep, elegant voice), "Oh, poor child.
My dear, I have to send you to my doctor.
"

1354
Brown:
1355
 (Chuckles)

1356
Akiyoshi:
1357
 You know (chuckling), things like that, he was....

1358
Brown:
1359
 Well, a couple of things that have come up.
First of all, I just want to fill in
some details: where was the rehearsal facility that you used, in what part of L.A.?
Was it
in North Hollywood, or was it in Burbank, or...?

1360
Akiyoshi:
1361
 Youre talking about in Los Angeles.

1362
Brown:
1363
 Yes.

1364
Akiyoshi:
1365
 It was the union.

1366
Brown:
1367
 It was the union hall, okay.

1368
Akiyoshi:
1369
 Union.
47, Local 47 union, and they had a rehearsal room.
And New York
didnt have it.
And as I said, it was 50 cents; today I think its $5.00.

1370
Brown:
1371
 But was it located downtown, or was it located where you were living?

1372
Akiyoshi:
1373
 No, Vine Street.

1374
Brown:
1375
 Vine Street.
You know where it is?

1376
Akiyoshi:
1377
 Uh, I guess thats North Hollywood.


1378
Brown:
1379
 You know where it is, okay.
So it hasnt changed, its still there, same place.

1380
Akiyoshi:
1381
 Yes, same place.
Its still there.

1382
Brown:
1383
 Okay.
And, more importantly, um ... blending in the tsuzumi sound: did you
have any kind of harmonic or tonal considerations?
Or what was your thought process in
blending it into the jazz orchestra?

1384
Akiyoshi:
1385
 No.
No, because they usually, fairly ... they dont have like a high-tone; but
they usually have a certain sound.
Theyre usually more or less the same.
They always
work in pairs: the one is ko-tsuzumi, small one....

1386
Brown:
1387
 On the shoulder, mm-hmm.

1388
Akiyoshi:
1389
 ...which goes on the shoulder; and the big one goes on the hip....

1390
Brown:
1391
 -tsuzumi, mm-hmm.

1392
Akiyoshi:
1393
 ...and oddly enough, the big ... small one makes a lower sound, the bigger
one makes the high sound.
And they always work together.
And I always liked the
sound, you know, so this was something that the first time I used.
And when, uh, I had
other ones, for example, "Minamata," for example, Kanze (Hisao)--we call it iemoto, the
one at the head of that particular style of n, you know, singing--hes deceased, but I
asked him to sing it for me, for this particular song, um, music.
So it was ... the tsuzumi
sound is pretty much the same, all things.
I think if you hear, maybe three or four
different n plays and if you hear that sound, its pretty much the same.

1394
Brown:
1395
 Yes, but you know--as probably you and I know, maybe some people who hear
this--in n drama, the tsuzumi players also have kakegoe (literally "hung voice"), right?
The vocalization: OOOooooh (mimics).

1396
Akiyoshi:
1397
 Yes.

1398
Brown:
1399
 So that's what Im talking about.

1400
Akiyoshi:
1401
 Oh, they make the great sounds to concentrate ... uh, the energy, then hit (the
drum).
And always the small tsuzumi player does that.
And the smallest, er, the biggest
one, they usually have a short, very short, low note sound.
They go (low voice) oooooh,
something like that.
But the one who makes the long, high-pitched (call), thats to
concentrate the energy, then they play.
The good players sound really, really nice on it.
They, uh ... have a Japanese paper, thats cut in a little bit, and they put that on the other


side (of the drum) to change the pitch the way they like, at the point where they like.
Thats what they do.
But as I always, you know.... Anyways, so that was my milestone.

1402
Brown:
1403
 So when you make the recording, but how can you tour this?
You have to take
these artists with you to tour, to tour, to recreate this piece when youre touring.

1404
Akiyoshi:
1405
 I have a tape.

1406
Brown:
1407
 (Laughs) Ha!

1408
Akiyoshi:
1409
 But twice we had real players, in Japan.
That was a luxury.
And also here at
the concert ... uh, uh ... the one time was at Carnegie Hall (recorded and released as
Carnegie Hall Concert by Columbia in 1991), and then another time at Sankei Hall in
Japan, they had a real player.
But most of the time, for example, we used to play every
Monday night at Birdland in New York, and every Monday night, and I had a tape
recorder set for that and prerecorded.
So, yeah, thats ... you know, if you are a classical
organization, you can afford to have, their budget will provide it, even though its like a
twenty-minute piece of music and all you need is one note (chuckles), they will, that
musician was hired.
We dont have that kind of luxury, so....

1410
Brown:
1411
 So now, Id presume that you look at 1974 as a ... this is now the land--, this is
the turning point in your career.
Do you now feel that you were successful as a jazz
musi-- did the success of Kogun...?

1412
Akiyoshi:
1413
 I think I did (to) some degree, yes, I do.
I have--as far as music is
concerned--I have close to 100 pieces of composition.
And uh, the most important, to
me, I think, probably the important music compositions would be ... they all have
Japanese kind of ... herita--Japanese culture is weaved in.
And also one is Hiroshima:
Rising from the Abyss (2001), that one has a Korean flute player (Won Jang-hyun,
playing taegm), who was also employed, so it has....
But Ive always preferred ... Im
very careful, Ive always been very careful.
In other words, there are many music--
especially nowadays in Japan--said, well, put Japanese culture (in).
Somehow, its not,
in my mind, its not working in all respects.
When you use something that wasnt there
before, you have to be very careful: its like ... you still ... somebody listens to it and
says, "That is jazz music, but its a little bit different.
" You know, some different color.
I think its coloring: Japanese culture, you can only do coloring, not like some, like,
Brazilian music, you know, took over the jazz scene at one point.
But not like that, just
coloring.
But it is like, has to be ... for example, if you eat something, something that
doesnt belong, like a stone or whatever it is, and (gets) stuck in your throat, and it ... it
cant be like that.
Music has to be something without any uh ... problem, any um, ...
teik, um ... resistance ... it has to go natural, natural in the ear.
And just like something
unnatural in there, something there that doesnt belong there, its gonna (get) stuck.
And


it shouldnt be like that.
So, (you) have to be very, very careful, which is, I think I have
been very careful.
So there was Hiroshima, thats ... "Minamata" is.... "Minamata"
from Insights, 1976) actually ... uh, Down Beat, gained their album of the year, which
was very nice.
It was a long time ago.

1414
Brown:
1415
 Mm-hmm.

1416
Akiyoshi:
1417
 Anyway, that and ... most things....
I have even, some of the things that are
very, very old-fashioned, its called "Relaxing at the Zell am See," not the Camarillo
laughs).

1418
Brown:
1419
 (Laughs)

1420
Akiyoshi:
1421
 But um--Zell am See, which is a famous ski resort in uh, Switzerland, uh ...
no, Austria, excuse me, Austria.

1422
Brown:
1423
 Mm-hmm.

1424
Akiyoshi:
1425
 And uh, it has real old-fashioned music, you know.
In the middle of it there is
a woodwind (passage) and theres uh ... tsuzumi, and it worked out very good.
You
know, there was ... Lew Tabackin said, "If you can swing that, Ill buy you dinner.
" So, he had to
buy dinner!
(laughs)

1426
Brown:
1427
 (Laughs) Well, sounds like you were, uh, very conscious, and even concerned,
about the audience reception your music, particularly in Japan, by integrating these
Japanese elements into your music.

1428
Akiyoshi:
1429
 No, I wasnt concerned.
As I said, I felt like they were going to put me down.

1430
Brown:
1431
 Yeah.

1432
Akiyoshi:
1433
 And I didnt really care.

1434
Brown:
1435
 Right.

1436
Akiyoshi:
1437
 I said, "Go ahead.
"

1438
Brown:
1439
 What about your concept about how the American audience would receive your
music?

1440
Akiyoshi:
1441
 How...?


1442
Brown:
1443
 Did you have any idea, or any concern about Americans receiving your music?

1444
Akiyoshi:
1445
 Not really.
I ... of course, I hoped people would find, would identify with the
music.
Thats the way we get uh ... you know, reputation or highly regarded, or
whatever it is.
But, (the) main things to me always been--for my entire career, whole
career--it is, I have to be very, very true to me.
Im the first listener, as far as the
writings concerned.
Im the first listener.
So if this wont ...
I want to convey certain
.. some music is, as you know--"Kogun," too, but there was "Minamata" and
Hiroshima"--all those are like programmatic music, which Duke Ellington used to write, but not
that many, you know.
Uh, and that means you have a message: you have a story to tell.
And that message has to be in to the listener, the correct way, and in order to do that, Im
the first listener.
So I have to be able to identify with the music.
How (do) I do that?
Thats the way the work is, its from the back.
And ... main thing is always, I have to be
true to me, and hopefully people will identify with the music.
But if Im not true to my
music, Im not worthy.
I mean, all these years of playing, you know, all the work will be
wasted.
So I always think like that, you know.

1446
Brown:
1447
 Just like you say that Japanese jazz fans are more purist, they want to have
authentic jazz, right?
Coming from America.
They presume that jazz is an American
music, and the authentic music is from America?
Authentic jazz?

1448
Akiyoshi:
1449
 Im not quite sure about (if) authentic is the right word.
I think they dont
really heard ... now that they dont, you know, they have great respect for me.
But the
point is, never done it before.
And they always ... the mainstream jazz fan is usually
interested in the individual players, which I agree.
I feel the same way.
And uh, so, but,
when youre writing for a large ensemble, theres an old way of saying, "A band is a
book is a book is a book.
" So its composition, which is not exactly how many ...
improvisation will be limited, and the whole compos-- it goes into a different category,
you know, I think.
And uh, but at the same time, it is like, player and writing, its like a
jockey and a horse.
Like <span class="fullMatch" id="match_409">Duke Ellington</span> never had a tenor solo til <span class="fullMatch" id="match_410">Ben Webster</span> joined the band,
so theres always, the great bands--like Count Basie was well known, it was (because of) Pres
Lester Young)--you know, always you have to have a great player.
Otherwise the
music doesnt have ... that highest ... uh, how do you say?
... high merit as music, jazz
music.
So there was a ... long time ago there was a discussion in Japan--I was still in
Japan--can you call (it) jazz if they have no improvisation at all, and it was all ensemble?
But its swing, its called....
But I think you can call it jazz, but at the same time, its not
very attractive, you know, its not very attractive.
Because if the improvisation is the
only merit of jazz, theres a lot of em, and all this.
You know, concerto of cadenza for
Isaac) Stern was improvised, everything like that.
So, there was a lot of those ...
European music has all that.
But as Duke Ellington says, you know, "it dont mean a thing if it
aint got that swing"....



1450
Brown:
1451
 (Chuckles)

1452
Akiyoshi:
1453
 ...so thats a part of it, you know, thats the way....

1454
Brown:
1455
 Right.
Well, I think youre bringing up the issue that jazz is more than just any
one particular element or any one thing.
It is a lot of different things: its swing, its
blues, maybe a blues-base, its improvisation, many different things.
But I want to talk to
you because, when I listen to The Carnegie Hall Concert, 1991, the piece for the children
"Children of the Universe"), which is, I believe, Hiroshima....

1456
Akiyoshi:
1457
 Oh yes.

1458
Brown:
1459
 ...I hear the way youre voicing the orchestra: its almost like the whole
orchestra is acting almost like, from gagaku (music of Japanese imperial court), you have
like the, what I consider severe portamento (sings), its almost like hichiriki (double-reed
bamboo flute) to me.

1460
Akiyoshi:
1461
 Yes.

1462
Brown:
1463
 So....

1464
Akiyoshi:
1465
 Hichiriki is a little different, but I know what you mean.
But "Children of the
Universe," that one, uh ... that ...
I kind of like that melody.
Its kind of like (sings)
teee-ah--ta, but ... that one is like, is probably more like explanatory.
First you start
with flute and tsuzumi.
So you hear very traditional Japanese, because Japanese think its
bending a note, you know, and uh ... and a tsuzumi player.
And you hear that, then when
the band comes in, the same melody, but uh ... they would have different ... uh ... cause
its harmony on top.
Its different, you hear different things: the melody is there, but you
know when it comes to the bridge, thats when the tempo starts and then the bridge, and
right there its just the old-fashioned jazz music, the ballad, like that.

1466
Brown:
1467
 Right.
But it sounds like youre mixing in--through phrasing, also some of the
chords, the way the chord, you know, sustained chords--to me sounds like sh (mouth
organ) and then like hichiriki.
Not really, exactly, to imitate, but use some of the idea of,
you know, the phrasing, so....

1468
Akiyoshi:
1469
 Oh yes.
The first one was "Sumi-e."

1470
Brown:
1471
 Mm-hmm.

1472
Akiyoshi:
1473
 That one I had written for the 67 concert ... you know, 1967 Town Hall
concert.
It was called "Sumi-e" and that was, I was writing in the middle--as I


mentioned before--from 12 oclock to 6 in the morning I was writing.
And uh ...
somehow I started hearing this gagaku sound and uh ... it took me quite an effort, but
that was played by trumpets.
Because I used to hear Japanese trumpet players bend a
note, you know.
And so thats whats typical Japanese gagaku sound: in other words,
two together, two together, like this.
And ... comes up top, while the melodys still
going, the same thing, now that was a very repetitious melody, keep going and third time
they have these things, weaving comes in.
And uh, I think it worked out well, but thats
the first time I did that, you know.
And when the first time with the band--Lew Tabackin got the
musicians together in the band in Los Angeles--first time we rehearsed, the trumpet
players were saying, "We cant bend the notes.
" I said, "Oh yes you can, because Ive
seen Japanese trumpet players do it, so if Japanese can do (it), you can do (it)"
chuckles).

1474
Brown:
1475
 Miles Davis did it all the time.

1476
Akiyoshi:
1477
 But thats one of ... very first one.
But uh, the one ... um, the tribute to Duke
Ellington, that was commissioned by the Monterey (Jazz) Festival, 1999.
You were
there.
And the second movement, which is "Eulogy," it was, the start was the same
thing: gagaku.
And it was like that.
And it was ... when the tenor comes in, it was a real
ballad, in my mind.
Its like, almost like, "Whats happened?
" like this.
But it was, the
second time you play you get into....
So theres an introduction that seems to ... and
when you repeat theres something added, next time you repeat theres something added.
Something, and it comes to a certain point, and it comes to a very traditional ... whatever.
It takes ... takes a lot of effort, but uh, thats what the writers supposed to do, you know.
Im not writing for a jingle!
(chuckles)

1478
Brown:
1479
 (Chuckles)

1480
Akiyoshi:
1481
 Im not facing a deadline.
So I always felt like Im fortunate to have the kind
of situation that I could take all the time in the world, so that I can always correct it if I
didnt think it was right.
That's the thing about the writing: you know, you playing and
you cant correct it.
I say, "Oh dear, why did I do that!
Its gone!
" (laughs)

1482
Brown:
1483
 (Laughs) You know, when I think of other artists, particularly composers and
musicians who are blending East, or Japanese, and Western concepts, I think of Tru
Takemitsu.
I dont know if youre familiar with....

1484
Akiyoshi:
1485
 Yes, yes.

1486
Brown:
1487
 ...because he was already blending not only concepts--

1488
Akiyoshi:
1489
 Yes, yes.


1490
Brown:
1491
 ...the way, the structure of the music--but also traditional Japanese instruments.

1492
Akiyoshi:
1493
 We were very good friends, because he really liked jazz.
When he got the ...
fellowship from--I forget the name, it was a famous one and all--he said he wanted to
study with Duke Ellington, and they thought he was joking.
You know, I mean, its a
real snob, classical field, but....

1494
Brown:
1495
 I think Richard Stoltzman said this in an interview in Down Beat: that--I think it
was a Fulbright scholarship....

1496
Akiyoshi:
1497
 Fulbright, yes, thats it.

1498
Brown:
1499
 ...in the late fifties--and they thought he was going to choose Aaron Copland, or, you
know, some other more classical composer, and he said no, Duke Ellington, and they just
.. and I think they withdrew it.

1500
Akiyoshi:
1501
 No, I dont think John Coltrane was there at that time, yet, that time, I dont
think he was.
I dont think so.

1502
Brown:
1503
 Oh, I didnt say ... no, I didnt mean ...
I didnt say John Coltrane (chuckles),
no, no.

1504
Akiyoshi:
1505
 Oh, oh, okay, sorry.
But anyway....

1506
Brown:
1507
 I said Aaron, Aaron Copland.

1508
Akiyoshi:
1509
 Oh, yes, right.
Thats what they said and it was ... but he, he wanted to, so....
But his November Steps is the classic one and he liked to use the biwa (lute, similar to
Chinese pipa)....

1510
Brown:
1511
 And shakuhachi (bamboo flute).

1512
Akiyoshi:
1513
 ...but he was such a sensitive writer.
He--I think we might have been the
same age, Im not quite sure (Takemitsu was born in 1930, ten months after Akiyoshi)--
he was a very frail person and drank quite a lot, so he had to be very careful about eating
and so on.
And he said, one time he said, "Well, why dont we write together?
"

1514
Brown:
1515
 Hmm!

1516
Akiyoshi:
1517
 And I said (sheepishly), "Well, I dont know.
" I cant write what he does, and
he cant write what I do.
You know (chuckles), thats what I was thinking, but he was....


My unfortunate thing was the last time we were having a temper and I said--because he
was writing a lot of movie music--and uh, "Do you like writing movie music?
" and he
said, "Oh, yes!
" So ... one thing is I remember Kaidan, Japanese (movie) Kaidan
1964)--that changed the whole movie background music and he was kind of
revolutionary with things--but he started writing some for American, you know, movies
and so on, blah, blah, blah, but if he didnt do that, he wouldve done more ... music for
listening.
Its not what we call "cue writing," not that, but we would have more
Takemitsu music, you know, I think about (that).
But somebody said he really loved
movies, so it was kind of, it was natural that he wanted to write for movies.
But uh ...
hes one of the, I think, maybe one or two Japanese composers who actually comes down
to the, you know, level, the international level, as a contemporary writer.
Very, very
sensitive writer.

1518
Brown:
1519
 (Receives cue from recording engineer) Okay.
So, Toshiko-san, were talking a
lot about now, as composer....

1520
Akiyoshi:
1521
 Yes.

1522
Brown:
1523
 ...I think that you have really changed, uh ... youve had an impact on the
vocabulary of jazz and tonal color, by bringing in the cultural elements from Japan.
Um,
but obviously you have a great regard and love for some of the people who came before
you, like in 1978, you made a recording dedicated to Billy Strayhorn (Tribute to Billy
Strayhorn, released in 1982 on Jazz America).

1524
Akiyoshi:
1525
 Oh yes!

1526
Brown:
1527
 So, talk about, you know, Billy Strayhorn, please.

1528
Akiyoshi:
1529
 I think that was a trio, my playing on....
I think Billy Strayhorn is some-- ... his
music, I wish I could really digest well.
Somehow, his music had a more ... different, uh
.. dimension.
I mean, Duke Ellington was always a great writer, but his music is more, uh ...
suited with singing, maybe, to words, and so on.
But I think Dukes greatness was
probably orchestration.
(??
Track begins in mid-sentence with syllable ui , possibly
the Japanese term for sad, gloomy), you know, a Japanese, it has a ... its a more
different dimension; his music is something (that) has ... for example--let me thinking
about the things, you know.
The music would, say, "Isfahan" really sounds like there
Iran); and things like "Lush Life," where its ... "Daydream" is something that
Billy Strayhorn family, somehow they heard the record and they really liked the way I
played, so I tried to listen to what they liked about it.
Im only playing very short
laughs), I didnt realize I played so short.
Thats such a long time ago, you know, over
twenty some-odd years ago.
But his music was something that ... for example, Lew Tabackin
plays it really well.
I wish I could digest it really well.
Many of his music (pieces) let me


think about certain things, that particular music.
Its not hunky-dory, happy-happy, or
anything like that.
It was, of course, his last one, "Blood Count," it really sounds like a
blood count, you know.
Hes one of probably ...
I always thought he was like as great a
jazz writer as Monk, but Billy Strayhorn has ... one doesnt have to be a jazz musician to
appreciate or understand or, you know, the music.
For Monks music, you kind of have
to be a jazz connoisseur to appreciate his music, I think.
But Billy Strayhorn is music I
always ... liked and I wish I could--even now--I wish someday, I probably hope to
digest his music and do some justice to his music in my playing.

1530
Brown:
1531
 Well, obviously, as you said, the Billy Strayhorn family saw some, saw your music,
your interpretation of Billy Strayhorn as very, very valuable, so thats great.
You know, when
you were talking earlier about John Lewis and how he brought in a lot of, you know,
Western classical influence....

1532
Akiyoshi:
1533
 Yes.

1534
Brown:
1535
 ...more, I know he loves Bach, you know, and very formal, very formalized, and
more Germanic tradition, whereas Billy Strayhorn, also very much influenced by classical
music, coming more from the French tradition.

1536
Akiyoshi:
1537
 But the difference is, I think, is that John Lewis was a player.

1538
Brown:
1539
 Mm-hmm.

1540
Akiyoshi:
1541
 I think--I know Billy Strayhorn played the piano--but hes not noted as a player.
I
know he had a couple recordings, but John Lewis was a player.
Also, (whats) interesting
about John Lewis, his compositions are very European, but ... for example, like, say....
He has written a duet, as you know, with Hank Jones--he respected Hank Jones like
mad!
So although the duet was like traveling, or it has so much European influence; but
when he comes to solo, hes, everything is, his root has always been blues.
Thats what I
think, you know, so thats a very interesting combination.
I think thats one of the
reasons, maybe, when Bags quit--Milt Jackson quit at one point, one time he quit--and
he disbanded (Modern Jazz Quartet), someone, Im sure there were several critical
musicians or whoever who suggested to him, "Why dont you use this guy or that guy,"
you know, great vibraphone players, and so on, but John Lewis wouldnt hear of it.
But
because, I think, thats the way he believed, the way music has to be played.
So it is a
difference between he and Billy Strayhorn, in some respects, I think, you know, something like
that.
Of course, Johns music is something like, very clean (laughs)--transparent is not a
good word--its like, but crystal, kind of.
Billy Strayhorn music is darker, to me.
Its more,
like I said, multi-dimensional.
I wish I knew the right words, the right English words for
Johns music, you know, like a certain....



1542
Brown:
1543
 Why dont you say it in Japanese?
Maybe we can get somebody to translate it
later.
Go ahead.

1544
Akiyoshi:
1545
 Yeah?
Uh, tmei ... tmeisei ... tmeisei (transparency, clearness, crystalline),
uh ... tsukitru (penetrating), tmeisei meaning tsukitru, its like something like ... its
like, uh (chuckles, frustrated).
I dont know how to say in English.

1546
Brown:
1547
 Its okay, well....

1548
Akiyoshi:
1549
 Yes, tmeisei, sei is ... um ... thats what I think, Johns music, I always feel
that that has that quality, and.... Its pretty much like, thats the way he plays: he plays
very ... little (few) notes and to some degree its deliberate.
All notes weigh a lot, and I
think thats something that ... in Billy Strayhorn case, thats not his forte.
I wish ... for
example, like, I love <span class="fullMatch" id="match_439">Bud Powell</span>, as you know, and I know quite a lot of his music, but
his music is never that ... uh, its mostly, its bebop-oriented, harmonically a little bit
intricate, but its really instrumental music, rather than uh, ... like Billy Strayhorn music--
well, maybe its written on an instrument--but its not really instrumental music.
It is a
composition that is saying something, and thats the difference.
Uh ... hes really a rare,
rare, rare, great writer.

1550
Brown:
1551
 So maybe clarity?
Im not sure thats a good word.
But um, in thinking of, um
.. John Lewis and Billy Strayhorn, influence of European music, um--also the way you
talk, you know, as a composer, also as orchestrator and arranger--theres so many
different things (that) go into shaping the music.
Now, you have somebody like Gil
Evans, who mostly is known as orchestrator, arranger, rather than composer.

1552
Akiyoshi:
1553
 Right.

1554
Brown:
1555
 Uh, could you talk about his music and/or influence, from Gil Evans?

1556
Akiyoshi:
1557
 No, Im not, I really didnt study his music much.
All I know is that he was,
before that he was writing for, I think it was a dance band, I forgot ... Claude Thornhill.

1558
Brown:
1559
 Claude Thornhill.

1560
Akiyoshi:
1561
 And uh, but ... he knew Miles Davis.
I think thats what he has written, orchestrated
for the two (LPs), as you know, Sketches of Spain and others and so on.
But his whole
group--he had it for quite some time--but it didnt really have that kind of impact.
But I
think hes ... (hesitates) I hate to say this--all due respect--he needed Miles Davis to show his
full capabilities as an orchestrator, maybe, you know.
He was a very sensitive writer.
Hes not a ... one of the things I always missed, he was very sensitive, but he didnt have
a real dynamic thing, you know, and it was like, uh ... <span class="fullMatch" id="match_449">Duke Ellington</span> has it, Frank Foster music


has it, you know, a real kind of dynamo.
But he had written, I think, arranged,
orchestrated, I think it was strings, um, Bill Evans played?
Its beautifully orchestrated.
Things like that: he was a beautiful orchestrator, I think, very sensitive.
But ... Im not
.. also, this is, I just thought about something that.... Before Gil Evans came out, I think
European writers really couldnt get with it.
They couldnt identify (with) Dukes writing
and Frank Foster writing, what have you.
And Gil Evans, the way he orchestrated, European
writers, they could identify (with it): "Oh, I can do that.
" I think its a ... in that respect, I
think hes more like a bridge to the European writers.
Some of them came back here,
some American writers, with very European writing.
I dont know if I make sense.

1562
Brown:
1563
 Oh, no, absolutely.

1564
Akiyoshi:
1565
 You know what I mean?

1566
Brown:
1567
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, I mean, uh.... We interviewed Hale Smith.
Do you know
Hale Smith?
Did you...?

1568
Akiyoshi:
1569
 No, Im afraid not.

1570
Brown:
1571
 Oh.
Anyway, hes a classical composer, uh, African American, and he worked
with Eric Dolphy; he also worked with Mingus.
But, he said, yeah, well, Gil Evans, you
can trace the direct influence back to a European classical composition, just like the
Aranjuez, you know, the Concierto, certain things like that, theres already a European
precedent, he just kind of recasts it in a jazz language.
So its true, its a bridge, because
you see the original source, he just recasts it, so....

1572
Akiyoshi:
1573
 Right, thats why I think that, so thats why now a lot of European writers start
writing and pretty much, some of the writers here, Ill say, "That sounds European"
chuckles).
You know, I think about that, something like that.

1574
Brown:
1575
 Well ... even somebody like who we were talking about--John Lewis and Billy
Strayhorn--but even ... you know, so we saw different ways of European classical
influence, you know, concert music influence.
But even Bud Powell wrote a through-
composed piece, "The Glass Enclosure.
" This is not a jazz piece (chuckles).

1576
Akiyoshi:
1577
 No, but, it is not a European piece.

1578
Brown:
1579
 Right.....

1580
Akiyoshi:
1581
 No.

1582
Brown:
1583
 ...but its through-composed (chuckles).


1584
Akiyoshi:
1585
 (Calling to husband) Lew-chan!
Could you do me a favor?
Take the
champagne out from freezer and put it in the fridge.
I dont want them to freeze.
Sorry.

1586
Brown:
1587
 (Laughs) No problem.

1588
Akiyoshi:
1589
 The ...
I think "Glass Enclosure"--one of my favorites, and Ive never played
it, I dont think I can play it--but I heard somebody play it.
But ... if you hear it, even
though no one, if I never heard the piece, and if I hear it, I can tell its Bud Powell.
I can tell its
Bud Powell, because....

1590
Brown:
1591
 How?

1592
Akiyoshi:
1593
 ...its the punctuation, harmonize, also the way he ... you know, he has a very
unique way of punctuating things and always been a very, very muscular player, a real
dynamic player.
And his touch was like that: it was not a, you know, like Teddy Wilson
or somebody like that (chuckles).
He wasnt like that.
I dont consider that to be
European music, in my mind, no.
And also, it may not have the pulse like that, but every
once in a while theres a pulse, you know (sings).
Thats a pulse to me.
Thats like a, its
real ... but it doesnt sound like European music, in my mind.

1594
Brown:
1595
 Mm-hmm.

1596
Akiyoshi:
1597
 But hes ... he wrote so many tunes, but I think they were, they were all very
good.
But its totally different from....
I think what a lot of bebop players have written
is totally different from something like a Strayhorn; bebop isnt a story, telling you
something, not that much.
Charlie Parker has written so many, but theyre riffs, so many,
you know, riffs, da-da-da-da, and so on.
So its not quite the same thing, I think.

1598
Brown:
1599
 Mm-hmm.
Well, it definitely shows some other influence other than strictly
through, uh, through jazz influence.
You know, again, its just getting ... like for
example, I want to ask you some other infl-- you know, you can like somebody; that
doesnt necessarily mean theyre going to influence what you do.

1600
Akiyoshi:
1601
 I, you know, what I think is that as soon as we hear something you like, I think
you are influenced right there.
It may not be....

1602
Brown:
1603
 Conscious?

1604
Akiyoshi:
1605
 ...obvious influence, but its not only music.
But I was very influenced by ...
there was a time when it was called "happening.
I guess the word happening, you know,
they are ... Robert uh, uh ...
Hamburger, you know, big hamburger (chuckles), those


days.
And by watching this, observing, if you have the money, you can put a quarter in
the box.
If you dont, you dont have to.
That kind of thing was going around there,
maybe at the time I was a student living in what they call Soho today.
Those days it
wasnt Soho (chuckles).

1606
Brown:
1607
 (Chuckles)

1608
Akiyoshi:
1609
 Um, but Im very much influenced by things like that, Im sure.
And I like
painting.
I dont understand anything about it, but I like painting.
And by ... anything
that ... you look ... uh ... read, could be observing a social issue--even if it has nothing
to do with music--its a social issue, a political scene, you know, all those things if you
observe it, I think they all influence....
I, personally, I think I was influenced quite by
everything.
Other than that, if its not, I wouldnt be able to, I wouldnt be producing
things like Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss, or "Minamata," or something like that.
Its
coming, maybe not (as) notes, but I ... the message and so on.
So everything I see, or
touch, observe, and if it gave me some kind of feeling, I was influenced right there by,
you know, different meaning, maybe.

1610
Brown:
1611
 Well, lets talk about your piece about Hiroshima, since you talked also about
how you have a political awareness, as well.
So this piece, when you were first
commissioned, you made comments that, that ... something to (the effect), "Why should
I write about this tragedy?
" Whats the connection?

1612
Akiyoshi:
1613
 Yeah, youre talking about the Hiroshima piece.
Well, that was commissioned
by a priest--who was here not too long ago, in New York, with his son--but anyway,
hes a jazz fan.
He has quite many, hes very aware of my music that I have written, uh,
Minamata.
" Thats why he asked me.
It was 1999 and I was in the midst of writing for
the tribute to Duke Ellington and it was--excuse me, 1998--so I told him, "Im kind of
busy," and he said that he would wait, and he sent me a photo ... uh, (mumbles), its
somewhere here.
The photo was taken three days after the bomb was dropped, and, uh--
I mentioned earlier, think yesterday--that I was born and raised in old Manchuria, today
China.
And uh, I never had an air raid experience or anything like that, and then after we
came back to Japan, the whole family in 1946, I started playing immediately in the dance
hall.
And also, at that time, there wasnt much talk about this bomb dropped by the
Americans.
I think, probably, Japanese journalists and government and so on were very
sensitive about not writing things like that: we were, you know, right after the Occupation
time, so I think thats....
So it never even occurred to me.
And then later on, after I came
to this country, I heard news about some of the girls who were victims came here for
treatment (the so-called Hiroshima Maidens).
I heard all that.
But I didnt really think
much of it, to tell you the truth.
So when he gave me this photo, and I was so shocked,
because I had never seen anything like this.
So ...
I wasnt quite sure if I could write
something like this.
And first of all, we were looking at it--that was done in 46, 194--


...

1614
Brown:
1615
 The bombing?
45.

1616
Akiyoshi:
1617
 ...1945, and here we are in, you know, 1998, and, first of all, when that bomb
was dropped, many, many people died, and horrible, horrible ... can you...?
First, does it
have any meaning writing music like that?
And uh, I didnt see much of a purpose in
writing music like that.
I didnt think I could write (it), and I was going to decline.
Then
I was just looking at a page and ... the one page that I missed, it was a young woman
who) was underground, so she wasnt affected, and she came out, and she just looked a
little bit, uh, and smiled a little bit.
And it was such a beautiful face--I know I have a
picture of her somewhere, Ill find it--anyway, uh, and then when I saw that, I said, "I
can write that.
" And it was, also ... even though the photographer who took this photo,
he also has written a series Full of Hope, you know, Face Full of Hope, and it was
definitely a beautiful photo.
I said, "I can write that.
" It was like, we have to have hope
no matter what.
Maybe, more reason you have to have, the more ... horrible the
situation, then you have to have more hope.
Like, uhhhh ... uhhhh ... Lama, great....

1618
Brown:
1619
 Dalai Lama?

1620
Akiyoshi:
1621
 Dalai Lama.
He said, "Well we cant live without hope," which is very true.
And I thought, "Im going to make this more like a piece of anti-war, anti-nuclear
weapon, weapon-anything, and it was ... and we will not ... uh, give up hope that
someday maybe people will tolerate each other (chuckles slightly), and at least theres no
war.
And we keep saying that, we keep just saying that to the world, you know.
That's
the way I wanted to write, and I think thats, thats what I think I wrote.
So its a very
long piece, a 24-, 25-minute piece, and its just ... some of the war, and after the war,
these people with mothers were talking about their ... memories, so on, so on.
And the
very last part, and it was the hope.
This place was a short one, but to me this is the punch
line.

1622
Brown:
1623
 (Chuckles)

1624
Akiyoshi:
1625
 I thought, "Well, this is a piece of hope, so Id like to play it in the 21st
century," and I said, I started writing in 1998, so.... And uh, so we did: 21st (century),
 August 6, in Hiroshima.
Then we had a little tour after that--maybe five or six
concerts--then came back to the United States, and then, of course, after thats 9/11.
I
still remember, that was a Tuesday morning, because we played Monday night, you
know, Monday night, always, and wed just come back from Japan, we had such a ...
I
had a terrible time trying to sleep and so on.
And uh, finally, I had kind of started
sleeping, then the phone rang, from my daughter.
And I heard Lew Tabackin say, "Really?!
Wow.
" And he went up and put the television on, and I said, "Oh my God, whats he


putting on the television for?
Im sleeping," and I looked, and then already, you know.
So, that was 9/11.
So after that, we always played at the very end of--Monday night, or
even if I play someplace else, it doesnt matter where it is--I always play that "Hope,"
that part, maybe about two minutes or so.
Very short.
So thats what we do in--thats
what I do (laughs)--any, uh, any situation.
No, I think ... you know, you were
mentioning before that, when you have many compositions, which one is your favorite.
People ask that, its just like uh, you were saying, its just asking somebody, "Which of
your children is your favorite?
" and it was....
But its something that probably ...
important compositions for me are probably "Kogun," "Minamata," and Hiroshima,
pieces like that.
And, I would like to think, "Children of the Universe," because that is
.. you know some-- ...
I dont even really listen to music and--jibun, you know, my
own--its a long time passed, maybe a couple of years or so on.
And then I listened to it.
And sometimes, even though at that time I thought it was good--thats why I recorded or
played it or so on--some music is ... gee, I dont know, I mean, uh, a little ... its not that
much impact, some music like that.
And then some music stands, and I think time is the
kind of judgment, judge of the music, I think, you know, the composition.
"Children of
the Universe," and then, I had written that one in 81, or 80, one of those years, and ... it
still stands okay today.
I listen to it.
So I feel very good about (it).
Many times when the
years pass, you know, twenty years later, and I say (sucks breath, sounds anxious), "I
dont know, this maybe ... a little too light-handed," or something like that, so....
I think
those ... all of them are very long (laughs), very long pieces.

1626
Brown:
1627
 (Laughs)

1628
Akiyoshi:
1629
 Its getting longer and longer!

1630
Brown:
1631
 Well, the pieces you mentioned--as you stated earlier--you are a socially
conscious person, its reflected in the music, particularly in the titles you just said were
important to you.
(Takes deep breath) When I look at Duke Ellington, yes, as we talked
earlier, he was very much influenced by his cultural, uh, background.
But also, Duke
Ellington had a very strong spirituality, particularly in his later period.

1632
Akiyoshi:
1633
 Oh, yes, of course.

1634
Brown:
1635
 So, for me that means humanity.
Uh, spirituality means humanity.

1636
Akiyoshi:
1637
 Yes.

1638
Brown:
1639
 So I see that in your music, as well.
Do you feel that theres any kind of cultural
influence in this consciousness of yours?
You mentioned Buddha before; do you feel that
Japanese culture or maybe just your early upbringing has had an impact on the way you
view the world?


1640
Akiyoshi:
1641
 I would like to, I would like to think it does.
I was mentioning earlier, that
anything you observe--it doesnt necessarily have to be music--but it could be anything
you observe and you felt something, right there you are influenced by (it).
So, that
includes everything: political scene, government, policymaking, and social issues, what
have you.
So I would like to think my music will have all that, you know, digested in
myself and comes out.
I would like to think that.

1642
Brown:
1643
 Well, I think your music speaks that, so....

1644
Akiyoshi:
1645
 Thank you.

1646
Brown:
1647
 (Laughing) ...I think you got that covered!
Um ... also, uh ... let me take just a
quick break, just a minute.
Um, here in 2008, its a very interesting year for America: we
have a woman running for president....

1648
Akiyoshi:
1649
 Oh, president, yes.

1650
Brown:
1651
 ...and a black man.
And when I think about your career--again, my mothers
Japanese--I think about her experience.
I know her experience directly, coming to
America, being Japanese, in the aftermath of World War II, where Japanese people
were) viewed as the enemy--even Japanese Americans, viewed as the enemy, because
they were put in the (relocation) camps.
So Im wondering: you come as a Japanese
person and woman.
Do you, how do you ... when you reflect back, look back--cause
lot of times you dont recognize it when its happening--do you feel that that worked
against you?
Obviously, in some ways, it worked in your favor, like you said you got the
scholarship from Berklee cause they could advertise, they used you for advertising.
Do
you feel that these, that you being a woman and Japanese worked against you in
America, whether its just being a jazz musician, or just the way you were treated
socially?

1652
Akiyoshi:
1653
 I think, uh, you know, I never thought about it til, uh, this woman issue came
out--I think it was (Germaine) Greer or someone like that from, uh, England--that
started this feminist blah, blah, blah.
I never really thought about being Japanese as ... a
handicap or as a ... so on, til ... there was a newspaper in Boston.
I was getting a lot of
attention: I was getting a Mademoiselle award (in January 1958) or things like that, or
became an ASCAP member.
And uh, the journalist who was writing, he wrote--I dont
quite remember the exact words of that one--but basically what he was saying was,
Why is she getting all this attention?
A lot of good Bostonian jazz players, theyre not
getting any limelight," or things like that.
So, I thought about, well, we have a saying, it
says: "stick out nail will be beaten" (laughs), so I guess thats what it is!
You know, and
track begins in mid-sentence) it was a big band.
It was just the first time when ...
I think


was seventy-, say sixty--I think it was 74, uh, September.
Thats what I think.
It was a
Friday night and there was a lot of attention.
And it was some paper--Im not quite sure,
I dont remember which paper, San Francisco or Los Angeles paper--but the paper, it
said, "I question her authenticity.
" That was, that was ... so, there were things like that:
its obviously because shes Japanese," you know, "its not authentic.
" But thats why,
when in 2007 I received the NEA Jazz Master and you have to make a little speech, and I
mentioned the fact that I came a long way from being written ... about "question her
authenticity," to what is the highest honor of a jazz player.
Because I think sometimes it
gets that kind of things because its ... we also have a saying: "a little bump above the
eyes can annoy" (laughs).
So it, like, annoys some people to get (??).
But if youre a
pioneer--I guess I am a pioneer, I think....

1654
Brown:
1655
 Mm-hmm!

1656
Akiyoshi:
1657
 ...you get all the heat.
But that comes with it, so you have to accept, you
know, everything.
Thats the way I think.
I was ... there was a lot of those ...
I decided
to have a very simple rule that I decided to have for myself.
It is, one, if I have no control
over what somebody else will say something, or like, say "Oh, shes Japanese," or Im
Japanese, I have no control (over that), Im a woman, Im a jazz musician, you know.
But I wont worry about it if I have no control.
But if I have control over (it), and then if
its, I dont like it, I correct (it).
You know, those two things.
So, if I have no control
over (it), I decided not to worry about (it).
But at the same time, that sounds so
wonderful and easy (laughs).

1658
Brown:
1659
 (Laughs) Well, there is ... (laughs harder) ... well, theres always, since we are
in America, and we are dealing with music, theres always the business side of things.
And that ... and during the course of this interview, youve talked about the challenges of
dealing with the business of this music.
And nowadays, were in the midst of this huge
change from the analog to digital and the internet, and many of the landmark recordings
youve produced are no longer available, or at least conspicuous in the marketplace.
So
obviously the business is something youve had to negotiate.
How do you feel--do you
feel you were successful in dealing the business, and if not, what would you change?

1660
Akiyoshi:
1661
 I dont do that.
I dont do that, because Im not capable.
So I just, uh, if
anybody were interested, they probably will offer something.
It its not, thats the way it
is.
I can only do what I can do, which is to try to do my best to write music or play better
than yesterday.
It may not be always that way, but at least I can try, you know.
Thats all
I can do.
And that gives me full time, you know, every day.
Its full time for me, so....

1662
Brown:
1663
 So once you become--this is what I learned from Red Callender--if you
become a musician, he said, youre al--... you know Red Callender, right?
Thats
Charles Mingus teacher, so uh....



1664
Akiyoshi:
1665
 What?

1666
Brown:
1667
 Charles Mingus teacher.
He said, "If you become a musician," he said, talking
to me, "you will always be a student.
You will never be a master.
" You believe this?

1668
Akiyoshi:
1669
 Oh yes.
Yes.
I think you try.
All you can do is try.
Because there are always
.. if you did something that you really wanted to correct, or achieve something, as soon
as you achieve that, theres another one in front of you.
Never, you know, um, fortunate.
But I think thats good.
Its ...
I feel sometimes fortunate that way that Im a musician,
because theres always something to do.

1670
Brown:
1671
 Well, Toshiko, during the course of this interview youve talked about this
career, this amazing career of yours.
Youre, you know--as you say yourself--a pioneer.
You had overcome so many things, whether its cultural, whether its musical, or
whatever, um, but yet youve succeeded, you know.

1672
Akiyoshi:
1673
 (Laughs modestly)

1674
Brown:
1675
 And the way to measure that is your own, what you feel is your own success.
And also you have been recognized: the Nanri award, you said, was the first award, and
when you had your big band in Los Angeles, you got many Grammy nominations....

1676
Akiyoshi:
1677
 (Laughs modestly)

1678
Brown:
1679
 ...so what were the other awards that meant something to you?

1680
Akiyoshi:
1681
 I think it probably meant something ... all awards mean something, because,
as you know, music is not a sport: theres no such thing as number one or number two.
But when you have an award or you have certain things, its because they are paying
attention to what you do.
At the same time, if they dont like you, theyre not going to
vote for you.
So theres some love involved; so you are loved by many people, so on,
and you are pay ... people pay attention to your ... what you do.
That's where the value
lies.
So I have ... all awards mean a lot.
But, I must say, for me, its the Master, Jazz
Master, because that comes from America, which is ... Im not an American citizen, and,
as I said, it came a long time, a long way from being written "not authentic" or what have
you (laughs).
So (for) jazz musicians, its an achievement getting National Endowment
for the) Arts to ... by recognize and given a fellowship, Jazz Master Fellowship, I think
thats about the highest I can ... you know.
I really, uh, when that phone rang--it usually
comes earlier and they say that you shouldnt talk til the official announcement and so
on--but when they said it, I thought, "Is this confirmed?
" First of all I said, "Is it
confirmed?
" and she said, "Yes, its (confirmed), congratulations," and blah, blah, blah.

And then, because ...
I have a ... Lew Tabackin always said--and often I mentioned at the
Birdland, you know, thing--Lew Tabackin always said I am "demographically challenged"
laughs).

1682
Brown:
1683
 (Laughs)

1684
Akiyoshi:
1685
 So I didnt really think I could get things like that, so ...
I think thats about
the highest, you know.
Im very, very grateful.
I think thats ...
I have to be, I dont
know if I am worthy.
I have to ...
I can try (laughs).

1686
Brown:
1687
 (Laughs) Well, I think, because you received the award, the jazz world knows
that youre worthy.
And so, Toshiko--unless you have anything else you want to add to
this interview--I just want to say, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award, just want to thank you so much for
allowing us to come into your house to document your life for the historical record.
Um,
we hope that this will be shared with many future generations to come, so they
understand that a woman from Japan can come to America and become a master of
American music.

1688
Akiyoshi:
1689
 Thank you very much for asking.
Thank you.

1690
Brown:
1691
 Thank you so much.
Domo arigat gozaimashita.

1692
Akiyoshi:
1693
 D itashimashite.

However, to avoid confusion and enhance readability, when appropriate I

 Today is June 29th, 2008, and this is the oral history interview conducted with
Toshiko Akiyoshi in her house on 38 W. 94th Street in Manhattan, New York.
Good
afternoon, Toshiko-san!

 Good afternoon!
5
 At long last, Im so honored to be able to conduct this oral history interview with
you.
Its been about ten years since we last saw each other--we had a chance to talk at
the Monterey Jazz Festival--but this interview we want you to tell your life history, so
we want to start at the very beginning, starting (with) as much information as you can tell
us about your family.
First, if you can give us your birth name, your complete birth
name.

 To-shi-ko.
9
 Akiyoshi.

 Just the way you pronounced.
13
 Oh, okay (laughs).
So, Toshiko Akiyoshi.


 Yes.
17
 And does "Toshiko" mean anything special in Japanese?

 Well, I think,...all names, as you know, Japanese names depends on the kanji
Chinese ideographs).
Different kanji means different (things), pronounce it the same
way.
And mine is "Toshiko," (which means) something like "sensitive," "susceptible,"
something to do with a dark sort of nature.
Most womens "Toshiko" is usually more
elegant, more woman-like, kinda, that kanji they usually use.
Mine isnt.
Whatever.
(laughs)
21
 (Laughs) Okay.
Can you tell us your parents, both your names of your parents?
And where theyre originally from.

 My fathers name is Katsur Akiyoshi.
My mothers maiden name is Hiraike,
so her name is Shigeko Hiraike.
And they were married, I dont know when, wherever,
laughs) and when I was born, Im the last of the four daughters.
Four daughters.
 And, uh, my father had a job in old Manchuria, today its called Liaoning
province of China, in (a) Japanese cotton, textile, company.
And the time when I was in
sixth grade, my father became independent and he started his own company, more like a
trading company.
27
 Can you tell me where your parents are from in Japan, before they migrated to
Manchuria?

 Oh, they were both from Kysh, ita....
31
 ita?

 ...province.
And, uh ...
I dont know much about (it) except that.
(laughs)
35
 (Chuckles).
Okay.
And can you give us your birth date?

 First part?
39
 Your birth date?

 I was born in 1929, December 12th.

43
 Twelfth.

 Twelfth.
Twelve-twelve, very easy to remember.
47
 Right.
And you were born, do you know exactly where in Manchuria?
I know
Dairen (Ch: Dalian) is whats recorded....

 I was educated there, but I was born in a place called Ryy, Liaoyang--I
guess they maybe pronounce the Chinese way, probably called Liaoyang--where the big
Japanese cotton textile company was.
So....
51
 So when you were living in China, um, Manchuria, or Dairen, did you live with
your sisters, so everyone grew up, you had the whole family there?

 Well, whole family ... Liaoyang city, it didnt have high school, so all my
sisters, they, when they came to graduate (from) grammar school, they all went to Dairen,
where (there was) a junior high, high school.
So, thats what my mother wanted.
Most
children, I think, in Ryy went to the city called Anzan (Ch: nshn), which is about an
hour, not even quite (an) hour, maybe 40 minutes train ride, the next big city from
Ryy.
But my mother wanted them to be educated in Dairen, I guess its considered a
better school for their....
55
 Now, was this a Japanese school...?

 Yes.
59
 ...and was there a large Japanese community?

 They were all Japanese schools.
(Its) amazing the fact, you know, Im
thinking about when I went to high school in Dairen, there was ... in those days, (it was)
like a man and a woman (were) different; boys had a boys high school, girls had a girls
high school.
And the girl high school alone, (Dairen) had five of them.
And each school,
I would say, when I was in high school, classes were about 45 students.
And we had five
class(es), I mean five different, you know, classmates, like, say, Cherries class, and there
was an ume (plum) club, there was like a chrysanthemum class, things like that.
63
 Based after, uh, flower names.

 Yeah, so basically, youre looking at it, girls alone (were) approximately 240
students in one class, one, yeah, one, what do you call...and we had a high school that
takes four years.
So if you multiply that, basically you have about, a little over one
thousand children.
Now, this is only girls alone.
So, lets say the boys are approximately


the same number, maybe more or less.
So from that you kind of estimate how many
Japanese were in Dairen, you can imagine how big the population was.
67
 And all instruction was in Japanese?

 There was ...
I dont remember having a Chinese student.
I think if they
spoke Japanese, there probably could have been.
But obviously there werent (any).
So
without my knowing it, they were, like, separated.
You know, (in) much later years,
much later, I dont quite remember, it was over ten years ago, I was asked by NHK
television, which is like the BBC, to go back to where I was born and raised, they called
it) Trip to Where the Heart Belongs (Sekai waga kokoro no tabi, broadcast Oct. 17,
, something like that.
And it was a new television series, and I was the first one.
And I hadnt been there in fifty years at that time.
And that time I realized the fact that is,
we were segregated (from Chinese).
You know, I never thought about it that way.
And,
when I went there--see, you cant do this without having a Chinese part of cooperation,
and they had people who spoke Japanese fluently, and they are the ones who set up a
tour--and from morning til evening we had Chinese food.
And it tasted very, very
good, but there wasnt anything like a, no ocean fish, except with the governors official
dinner, or mayors official dinner.
Other than that, fish, every once and a while that
would be the river fish, freshwater fish.
And I realized that we were considered,
probably, a privileged class, and I thought they were probably looking at us like that.
I
didnt realize til then that Japan is ... one of the things that I was thinking about,
sometimes compared to, lets say, this country had a long history of prejudice to(ward)
anybody who had color, you know, the black people, or the yellow, whatever.
And the
old days, as you know, America had segregation, you cant ride on the same bus, what
have you.
But one thing about Manchuria, now China, their railroad was built by a
Japanese railroad company (South Manchurian Railway), but they were more advanced
than in Japan: the rails were wider, and also it didnt matter if they were Chinese or
American or Japanese--I guess there werent any Americans there, I dont know
laughs).
Maybe there were some, priests maybe.
But, if you had the money, you could
ride first class, second class, (??
) class, you know.
So there was no--as far as that is
concerned--there was no segregation as far as that is concerned.
I think thats, you
know, something.
I never sort of ... also, we were, it was mandatory to learn Chinese,
from the third grade.
Boy, its a hard language, Chinese!
(chuckles).
71
 Do you remember any Chinese?

 Oh yes, yes, but Ill tell you one thing: if I stayed in China for, maybe, one
month, without talking Japanese, you know, I think Id get (it) back.
I think I ... because
all together, three, four, five, six, then it was junior high, one, two, ... seven years of
Chinese.
When I was third year of high school that the war was going pretty bad, so in
fourth grade the war was ended.

75
 When did you learn English?
Did you study English in school?

 English was from high school, the very beginning of high school, and, uh, the
war started when I was (in) sixth grade, and about a year later, no, maybe two years later,
English was taken off from a mandatory class, and it was you could attend the class as a,
if you wanted.
So, it wasnt like a regular class, but you could apply for (it).
Which I
did, but I did terrible, I mean I was just....
Language wasnt (laughs) my forte.
79
 So when you learned Chinese, of course, kanji is the big difference, and learning
all the kanji, so....

 Kanji, yes, kanji, some (of them) mean the same, because, after all, it came
from China.
But most of them are different.
Some are the same meaning.
But it is a
really hard language, the pronunciation is hard (chuckles).
83
 Tonal, as well.

 Yeah, thats what I mean.
Its the same thing, but it depends on the tone ...
87
 "N ho ma.
"

 ... yeah, different meaning.
So its a very hard....
91
 So you were talking earlier about the difference in the social strata.
So, you
were considered, your upbringing, your social class while you were in Manchuria, you
were very comfortable?
Youd only....

 Yes, I really, I dont think I was the only one, but when I was in childhood, I
never even thought about things like that.
I was a very, maybe simple-minded.
When I
was in first grade a third-grade child played the Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart Turkish March and I liked to play
just like that, thats how I started playing piano, studying piano.
And, uh, always been, if
I listened to my parents at home, if I listened to my teachers at school, Im okay, stay out
of trouble.
So I never really thought about anything.
95
 So you just recounted your earliest inspiration about piano, you said you heard
another student playing the Mozart Turkish March, so, Rondo Alla Turca (scats a melodic
phrase, last movement of Piano Sonata No.
11 in A Major).

 Right.
99
 So this was your first recollection of your interest in music....



 Yes, piano, yes.
103
 So ... a classmate?
You say another student played this?

 Yes, no, no, she was in third grade, I was in first grade.
So, thats when I
started, I wanted to play, so started when I was in first grade, started taking lessons.
107
 Was this unusual?
Did any of your older sisters have piano lessons, or were
musical?

 Well (sighs), Im not quite sure.
The only thing, we didnt have piano teacher-
teachers.
I had to learn from, uh, there was a music class teacher (who) was the piano
teacher.
Im not quite sure how great they were, you know, at that particular point, but
Id go twice a week to his home to study.
I still remember it was an upright piano, and I
had to go from where I lived, my family lived, to the teachers house, youd have to walk
for half an hour, to get to the place, you know.
And it was very ... when I think about it
now, I think in many ways, today people would consider, "Boy, that was a hard life," or
something, because everyday youd have to get to school, walk about half an hour, takes
half an hour to get to school, and same thing coming back.
So, uh, I think it is an
American standard, if youre that far, you have a school bus, you know, (we) didnt have
anything like that.
But, this may not be appropriate time or anything, but when my
daughter started going to school here, I realized that I had a much better education than
my daughter.
And ... it was nineteen-sixty .... my daughter was going to PS-41 and it
was sixty-, lemme see, I dont quite remember, it was mid-sixties, I think.
But anyway,
she came back and she said, "Well, (there is) no more music class, because the budget
was cut.
" Now, (she said) the next time, "Oh, no more, uh, what do you call, tais
calisthenics), physical fitness education because of budget cuts.
" And I thought, "What
a strange place that this could be," because when I went to school in Manchuria, Im sure
everybody agrees, Japan was a poor country.
I can tell by looking at old film how life
was very humble and poor, I can tell by films when I see it.
But the whole attitude or
philosophy is like, children must be educated, must be educated, like to be educated,
therefore, budget must be spared.
And, vice versa here.
And, I dont know about today,
but when my daughter went to grammar school, America was the richest country, you
know, I dont think as much debt as today (laughs), deficit as today.
And I thought it was
a very strange country, somehow the priorities were upside down.
So thats what I
remember, so I think I had a very good education, and music education, as well.
111
 Were all your teachers Japanese?
Do you remember?

 Oh yes, they were all Japanese, except when I started high school and I started
taking lessons from a pia-... there was a music school there, and then I would go there to


study with, this piano teachers name was Yang (Xiaoyi)-sensei.
We called (him) Y-
sensei, and it was a Chinese person.
Um, miraculously, actually, when I went back to
Manchuria, old Manchuria, for the television, they found him, he was over 80 years old,
and ... Yang-sensei.
And I asked him, "Why (do) you speak Japanese so well?
" He said,
Oh, I went to, I was educated in Japan, Japanese music academy, he went.
It was
Musashino Music School.
And, uh, of course he was two years (in the) Cultural
Revolution, and he was sent to a farm, and he couldnt talk about the music and so on and
so forth, nearly thirty years.
And he was actually permitted to come back and teach, but
that was ....
So he was my teacher, he was a Chinese man, and I still remember, we had
in high school, we had one of our classes was the sewing class, had to sew.
And the high
school had a pool, and I stung my finger with a needle and I went swimming so it kind of
became infected, so I couldnt really play the piano, so I just went--I never missed a
lesson, never, in all that time, Im proud to say--so I went there and I showed Y-sensei
and said, "I cant play because I ...." So he really got mad at me, he said, "Youre a
pianist," you know, "you shouldnt do some stupid things like that," or something like
that.
He got terribly upset and mad at me.
115
 How old were you?
(chuckles)

 I was probably about ... fourteen?
Or maybe thirteen and a half?
119
 So youd been studying for a while by then, six or seven years.

 Yes, yes.
123
 Okay.
Um, I asked earlier about your older sisters.
Could you tell me their
names, and if they had any musical training?

 Who?
127
 Your older sisters?

 My oldest sisters name is Hisako (spells it).
The second sisters name is
Miyoko, who is alive and well, we are very close.
And the third sister, it was interesting:
my father, like any other Japanese father, uh, man, they always wanted to have a boy.
So
they got a girl, the next one was a girl, then the third one was also a girl, so he was
hoping, he said, "Well, this will be the zero for the girl," so he named her Reiko.
Rei is
like another word of saying "zero.
" So, then here came (chuckles), here I come
chuckles), so he just named me Toshiko, because thats probably a normal name
laughs).
131
 Any of them musically inclined, or were either of your parents musically


inclined?

 No, actually, Im the only one, but my older sister always liked opera, and my
second sister is a quite accomplished Japanese traditional dancer.
My immediate sister
doesnt really have any interest in it.
My mother was interested in music, but she wasnt
very, lets say, she wasnt talented enough.
My father was a student, he was very,
extremely interested in n, N-O-H, you know, mens ....
135
 N drama?

 Yes, he studied for quite (a) long time and he actually had a diploma to be, to
be able to teach others.
So he was n singing and dance, but no one was ... my case was
the piano, but the music, you know, was ....
139
 But it was more Japanese traditional music, not Western or ... well, you said
your sister liked opera ... but the training of everybody was more traditional....

 No, it isnt.
Because Japanese school, the music class, is all Western.
I
remember when (we were) in grammar school, there was "Home on the Range" (laughs),
things like that were in the book.
And everything was European, Western.
If you were
interested in learning some Japanese music or dancing, you had to do outside-of-school
activity, which my second sister did.
143
 What kind of music did you hear around the house?
Was music played,
recordings, radio, or maybe outside, down in the streets?
Do you have any memories?

 Well, when I started to play, started piano, I dont really think much ....
Actually, we had, I think, a gramophone, you had to do by your hands, kind of thing.
And my mother liked it, like Deanna Durbin (laughs).
I remember, (when I was)
seventeen, eighteen, it had, the label part (of the record) had her picture.
And I think it
was probably the Traviata (sings).
I think thats what it was.
Something like that.
But
other than that, I didnt really hear, except my, as I said, my older sister loved opera.
So
when, when I was in the fourth grade, my sister was already in high school way up
there..., no, graduated high school, actually.
And ... Ryy is a very historical city for
Chinese history, I think, because it had a walled city.
But they didnt really have
anything, there was a ... today it is the capital of Liaoning province, its called Shnyang,
Mukden in Manchu), those days it was called Hten (in Japanese).
That was a big city.
And there was a Japanese opera company, called (after founder and tenor) Fujiwara
Yoshie, Fujiwara Opera Company, (that) came there, and my sister wanted to see it.
And, oh, that took ... my mother was traveling, I think she visited her relatives in Japan,
so (she) wasnt there.
My father had to ask to my school to get me off early because (so)
I could take the train.
It took a couple of hours to get there.
And there was ... that was


La Traviata.
I still kind of, sort of remember seeing (it).
Anyway, maybe because of that
I dont like opera (laughs).
147
 (laughs).
Okay.
So, um, while you were studying piano, did you have any
preferences as far as the repertoire?
Did you like Mozart, Chopin?
Did you like
Beethoven?

 No, first, (I) started like everybody else.
You start from (Gabriel) Baille and
Carl) Czerny 30 (New Studies in Technique), 40 (Daily Exercises).
About 40, then you
went to other things, then the same time you do (a) sonatina.
By the time it was Yang-
sensei it was sonatas.
But, like every other, studying piano, there was a normal
procedure.
Its not like today, people do some other different ways.
So that was the way
it was.
I didnt really have any preference or anything.
But when I went to high school,
as I said, going to the sonatas, obviously it was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_12">Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</span> and Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven, and, uh, I was
very much into Beethoven.
I was really ... and then I remember in high school and I
saw, those days it was 78 (RPM records), so its like if you have like a concerto or
something it doesnt go on one (record), so you have to have one or two or three or
something like that (chuckles).
And I still remember Rudolf Serkin Apassionata
Sonata (Piano Sonata No.
23, recorded 1938), and I listened and--ooh, ahh--I really
kind of admired (it), and I was thinking, well, someday maybe Id like to visit Germany.
Things like that.
151
 So it was Beethovens music?
Was it the particular way of playing it?
Or just
the sound or both?

 No, I think it was Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens music.
His music was ... its not quite ... you
know, I dont think (at) that particular time I didnt think anything the way Im analyzing
today.
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens music is more ... (to) some degree, I think--this is probably a far-
out analysis--but <span class="fullMatch" id="match_18">John Coltrane</span>, like, compared to <span class="fullMatch" id="match_17">Sonny Rollins</span> ... Sonny Rollins, if it was
everyone like that, you might as well forget about it, or something.
Certain things,
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven had certain things, more, try harder kind of things.
Wolfgang Amadeus Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, on the other hand,
is very natural and sounds always like angels or whatever it is, or, sounds more natural,
and it wasnt interesting to me.
Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethoven was the one I kind of identified myself with.
So I think everybody is different, but it was just, thats what I kind of, I think, identify,
you know.
155
 Did you finish high school before your family emigrated to Japan?

 No.
No.
Before I finished high school (the) war was ended.
So I was an
honorary graduate," just like anybody else in my class.
So, thats the year I was
supposed to graduate, the following year in March.
Here, everything (begins) is
September, but in Japan it was March, the (school year) starts from April.
So the war


ended in August, so there were a few more months to go, which we all did not go, we just
graduated "honorary" (chuckles).
159
 So when the war started, do you remember, did it impact your life, or,
economically or consciously?

 Oh yes, of course (sighs).
You know, one of the things about that ...
I have
been ...
I wasnt going to school in Japan, so I have no experience of air raid, I have no
experience of severe conditions, because Manchuria was still ... and also something to do
with my fathers business, I dont remember having a problem with a shortage of food or
things like that.
So actually I didnt really start thinking til I was third year in high
school, there was....
Either you started going to a factory to sew military clothes, or also,
if you wanted to become a nurse.
And I thought, well, in the war if I can do something, I
should become a nurse, and I volunteered to become a nurse.
And I went to my mother
and I said my father said it was okay, and I went to my father (laughs) and I said my
mother said it was okay, because my fathers business was in Ryy, so still he
periodically visited, but I was in a school in Dairen, and at that time, because Im
probably the youngest, my mother came with me to live.
So (the family) was kind of,
sort of separated, in a sense.
So I told both, "He said okay, she said okay" (chuckles).
163
 (laughs)

 So I went and I had training for four months, and (after) four months training
was going to be finished, thats when the war was ended (laughs).
167
 So then what happened.

 Then, after that it was very difficult.
Uh, what I understand is this may not be
all the gossip, it could be very true.
Because when you start thinking about how the
Japanese military runs, what I understand was the ones who decided, they had a meeting,
they thought maybe ... you know, we were about fifteen and a half years old, all (of) us,
to give them (students) poison, instead of them becoming prisoners of war or something,
thats what I understand.
That was actually, even that came up at the meeting.
So Im
very happy to know that they decided to try to send them back to their parents.
That was
a very hard trip when I think about it, because you had to go under the..., at that time,
Russia was already into the war and Russians were already into Manchuria.
So, under
the hiding from them, you had to go to certain points, you stay in ground....
171
 Underground.

 Not underground, a tent, you know what I mean.
Id never done that before
laughs).
So that was kind of a hard trip.
One time we were on the train and the Russian


soldiers came through, and everybody, we all cut our hair very, very short, and it was ...
we had one those uniforms, and it was dark so there wasnt anything (that) happened or
anything.
That was also kind of (a) not pleasant experience.
Anyway, that was hard and
it was ... think about ... the place where we were trained, it is on the map, it was close to
China.
When youre looking at Manchuria and China, the land is the same, except its
separated by a border, whatever it is.
And Dairen, it is close to China, and Ryy is in
the middle, kind of the middle of Manchuria.
Sort of north in the middle, northeast, little
bit east, in the middle.
And where we were trained, it was close to Dairen, it was west of
Dairen.
The way they came is, they go ...
I was the first one, I left ... they stopped (in)
Ryy, and I stopped, and everybody thought I shouldnt go home, but I did.
Which
means ... logically speaking, Dairen would be the first, because it was closer, than to go
to Ryy, if they were, you know....
But they went around (Dairen), meaning they
probably had to go that way to hide from the so-called enemy.
It took a long time, I think
that was a hard trip.
And when I got off the train and I walked to my home and I got to
my home, there were Russian soldiers (who) were taking all (of our) things from (the)
house (chuckles).
And our house was in front of a park, you know, and in the park, (there
were) all these Chinese merchants waiting (chuckles).
And they go there and they were
selling (our things), of course, the Russians, and theyd come back and get more
chuckles), take something away.
I was....
175
 So your family wasnt in the house?

 Of course they were.
179
 But everybody was still taking out the belongings?

 Of course.
183
 While they were there?

 They were soldiers, you know.
And, uh, so I just came home (in) the middle
of all this.
My father he was like really, I think he was probably frightened, "Oh my
God!
" (chuckles).
So that was.... And the next day, he had arranged so that there would
be an underground, you know, you can go to a.... You know Japanese have tatami
bamboo woven floor mats), and under tatami was the floor, and under the floor was a
little room for ... just a little bit of room so we could just hide there.
187
 So you were hiding underneath the tatami, underneath the floor.
You were
hiding from the soldiers because you were afraid that they would...?

 Thats right, because they came, but you never know.
They basically came to
get the stuff, but sometimes they were not....
So, you know....


191
 So after they ransacked your house, then what happened with your family?

 Oh, just, we were fine, I was the only one who wasnt together (with them),
except my oldest sister was married to a military man, so they were in China, they
werent there.
Um ... this was, as I said, it was 1946, uh...1945, excuse me, summer,
and til 1946 we were permitted, we left there, the first time it was occupied by Russians,
then there was the Chinese communist army, and at that time they occupied ... a
lieutenant--actually his wife was also a lieutenant--they occupied our houses upstairs.
And then after that, it was the (Chinese) Nationalist Army, Chiang Kai-sheks army, and
they occupied the upstairs, too.
The time we were leaving, they were getting, you know,
more communists were coming in, but thats when we left.
But it took, uh, it was almost
a year.
But, I think we were earlier than the people in Dairen.
195
 So what happened to your fathers business?

 Well, what happened?
(laughs) I mean, we couldnt have anything....
Everyone who went back to Japan from any(where) abroad--not just China, Im sure
there were other places--they could only bring what you could carry.
No jewels.
And
also, there was a ... (the) yen changed to new (currency), so all the money, it didnt mean
anything, and it was a ...
I remember it was one person, 1000 per person, was given by
the) government when you got into Japan.
So we were four children with parents, so I
think it was 6000 was given from the government.
I remember getting into ... its near
Hiroshima, a place called Ujina, you know, port, and you got in there and you got DDT
on the top of your hair, bong (laughing)!
199
 Really?

 Yeah, yeah (laughs).
203
 So as (laughs) soon as you got to the port, they disinfect(ed) everybody like that?

 Well, I think it was because everybody was coming back from wherever it
was, theyre probably, maybe carry(ing) something.
American soldiers, we all got
powder, white powder, DDT, pshoo, pshoo (laughs).
207
 Oh, from American soldiers.

 Of course, from (the) American side, you know (chuckles).
211
 So what was your first impression when you got back to Japan?
(Was) this your
first time in Japan, then?


 No, I had been several times with my mother, because my mother often
visited, and because I was the youngest, so she always took me along, so many times.
But (sighs), first, I tell you, first my impression from Ujina port back to where my parents
came from--we settled in Beppu city--and the train, to me the train looked like a real toy
train, because I think I mentioned earlier, the train in Manchuria was wider, railroad was
wider, and a much better train, and in Japan it was still kind of narrow.
Even today if you
go to some parts, northern parts or someplace, also Hokkaid railroad, its still old,
narrow.
So first my impression was, "What a small train!
" (chuckles).
215
 So youre sixteen years old, youve already (laughs) got training as a nurse, a
volunteer nurse, you have piano lessons.
Do you have an idea of what life, or what you
want to do for a career?

 No, actually, my parents wanted me to go to medical school.
But we got back
to Japan in July--I dont quite remember, fourteenth or fifteenth, I think, middle of July
anyway--and I mentioned earlier that the Japanese school starts (in the) spring, so I had a
few months.
And meanwhile, (in) Beppu I saw this dance hall, they had a flier pasted on
the window saying "Pianist wanted.
" So I went in because ...
I knew my parents no
longer could furnish me with a piano, it was that kind of condition.
They didnt even
have a place to live of their own for the time being.
So, uh, I went in and I was hired like
immediately because.... See, Beppu city, it is a very small city, I dont know if you
know), Im sure you do, its a hot spring (resort).
So there was a small (U.S. military)
camp, meaning there were many dance halls for Americans.
And, as you know,
Americans could not come to Japanese (places), Japanese could not go to Americans.
So Japanese wanted to dance, too, so there were Japanese dance halls, a few of them.
There werent that many musicians living in Beppu.
So I said, "I play piano," and I was
hired just like that (chuckles).
219
 And Beppu is B-E-P-P-U?

 Yes.
223
 So, uh, what kind of band, what was the instrumentation for this band?

 Its leader was a violin player.
I suspect he probably was, used to be (in) the
navy band.
He was an elderly person, everybody else was younger.
And it was violin,
accordion, drums, alto saxophone, piano.
Thats it.
227
 All Japanese musicians?

 Of course.
And there was a Hit Kit ... you remember Hit Kit?
I dont know.

Army Navy) Hit Kit (of Popular Songs) is one of the things that the servicemen ... every
month or maybe twice a month, Im not quite sure, it was American hit songs.
It was for
the American servicemen.
And you could get them, I think they had all those, you know,
Five Minutes More," or like "Shoo Fly Pie," what have you (laughs), things like that.
It
was lead sheets, thats what they played.
I didnt know any chord symbols, Id never
seen (those) in my life.
So I said, "Whats this?
" So the violin player said, "Oh she
doesnt know anything!
" And, uh, "Can you play piano?
" So I played Ludwig van Ludwig van Beethovens
Sonata No.
3 (sings), and he said, "Oh, she can play piano!
" (laughs) So that was the
beginning.
And, uh, I was hired for the dance hall for Japanese.
I think that was
probably a good... it was lucky, because a Japanese record collector....
When jazz was
exported to other countries--I dont know about Europe, but exported to Japan--they
mostly appealed to the upper-middle-class young people.
So they had, some of them had
collected records.
And this person was Mister Fukui.
Hes still alive and well, I hope.
I
saw him three years ago.
But ... he was one of the collectors.
And he noticed my
playing, so he invited me over to his home, and he played Teddy Wilson "Sweet
Lorraine"--this became a very famous story.
But when I heard him playing it, I said, "I
want to play just like that!
" So that was my first introduction to jazz.
And I think it was
lucky the fact that he played Teddy Wilson, because as you know Teddy Wilson played
such a clean, beautiful--actually swing-style pianists all played very clean--but his in
particular, he had a technique, and his own runs were like the same string of pearls, you
know, like beautifully played, and it was not like today, in the old days people didnt use
the pedal, so they all came out so nice and clean.
And that was really good, I think, it
appealed to me a lot.
So after that I tried to listen to records --he had a couple of
different records--and about eight months later, I was hired in Fukuoka city.
So I moved
to Fukuoka city.
I was seventeen years old, I think, seventeen years old.
My parents
were like (groans).
But one thing about ... when Japan lost the war, there was a certain
structure that was broken, in other words, the family, the structure had always been the
father was the beginning, was at the middle, and hes the big pole; the mother (was) the
support, the parents, and the children were supposed to listen to the parents, like that.
When the war was ended my father, for a while he didnt know what (had) come over,
what hit him, because it wasnt his fault that he lost everything, and he hadnt even
foreseen, the Japanese never thought they were going to lose a war.
So, they lost it, he
lost everything, and he really didnt know what to do.
And that affected the children.
I
was at that time fifteen years old, and it just affected.... And when we went back to
Japan that was already broken, the way my father had to try to find a place for us to live,
too, and so on, and meanwhile I took a job in a dance hall, and that was, like, unthinkable
for ... my father got really mad.
But, uh (chuckles), because the normal situation in
Japan in those days, the girls never worked, they dont work til they go to ... then they
married.
Its not ... if youre in the middle class, the girls are not supposed to work.
So,
its a special dance hall, my God, you know, evil place (laughs).
231
 (laughs) What else, what ... you mentioned a few titles, but what was the


repertoire?
I mean, what was the repertoire you were playing, so this gives an idea of
what kind of dancing was going on?

 Well, I dont quite remember everything.
As I said, I remember "Sweet Sue,"
you know, "Shoo Fly Pie," or "Five Minutes More," I remember those.
"Home on the
Range" was there, too.
Things like that.
I dont remember til later on when I was hired
and then moved to Fukuoka, and I was hired by a big band.
This was the first big band
excitedly), and it was Ryutaro Yamada and his band, his orchestra.
235
 Say it again?
What was his name?

 Ryutaro Yamada, yes.
He was an old musician, played trumpet and piano, I
understand.
But (at) the officers club, you kind of had to, somebody had to stand in the
front to wave his arms (conduct), so he had to do that, so he needed a pianist.
So I was
the one.
And this was really great, because the officers club had a--we call (it)
denchiku, you know what I mean?--like a gramophone, you had to do by hand, but this
was, because it was plugged in, you didnt have to do that.
And....
239
 Like a jukebox?

 Yes, it was more like a jukebox, not really, but its still a gramophone, it was
the same thing, except it was run by gears, electric.
And theyre bigger.
And that was
the first time I saw a V-disc (Victory disc).
V-disc was a 12-inch, you know, plastic, like
before that, a 17-inch, if you dropped it, it broke.
But this didnt break.
So that was like
a pioneer of, later on, the 10-inch LP, I think.
Because this was already 45 (RPM) speed.
And thats when ... daytime I could practice piano there and I listened to all those
records.
Thats the first, that was a really great job for me.
And then I ... and then of
course this was a large ensemble, so they had, you know, the stock arrangements, they
were given by, I think, the American side to the band.
So they were all stock
arrangements.
And then, stock arrangements usually, like a four-bars intro, then they
have ensemble, then there was a (place to) modulate, because the middle part was for the
singer.
So thats what ... since we didnt have a singer ... and stock arrangements
usually had a tenor solo, trumpet solo, something like that, then it was ensemble, then
finish.
That was a stock arrangement.
And I remember a lot of those.
And I remember
one was ... the pianist had nothing to do, you know, in a big band, just chang-chang, so
one day there was a new one, it was "Near You," and its middle part was a piano solo.
And I was very excited, of course (laughs).
So (scats) "near you" (scats) "near you.
" So
I was ... (in the) daytime I practiced my "improvisation" (laughs).
I practiced my
improvisation" like mad!
I was hoping he (Yamada) was gonna call that sometime, and
then one day he called it, and my heart went doot-doot-doot, so I played what I practiced.
So, Mr. Yamada said, "Everybody backstage!
" You know, there was a band room.
And
he said, "Did you hear her play?
Did you hear her play?
Just because she tried to come


up with something, she sounds like a Filipino!
" (laughs) Those days, Philippine players
had better sense as a jazz player, so obviously, because they were under, they were
colonized by America for a long, long time.
So theyre exposed to jazz longer than
laughs) Japanese.
And that was really funny!
243
 So that was a compliment.

 Yeah!
247
 (laughs, claps) Well, lets go back, you said the first jazz recording you heard
was Teddy Wilson.
Teddy Wilson is improvising.
Up until this point, had you even
improvised?
Had you even ...?

 Yes.
No, I prac-- I had to take from records.
I had to take the solo and song,
because I didnt know any songs.
So solos, and I tried to play that solo.
It doesnt make
any difference, especially when I was in Fukuoka, I took a solo, from eight bars, you
know, Wilsons solos, things like that, everybodys.
And then I tried to play it on the
piano.
251
 So you were transcribing, or just by ear memorizing and then playing,
transposing to piano?

 No, I had to play many times to, just to....
255
 So you were actually writing and transcribing?

 Right, exactly.
259
 And then you used that?
Okay, so were going to change tapes.

 Okay.
263
 Okay, Toshiko-san, I wanted for you to, um, as much as possible to describe that
process, since you were classically trained as a pianist, and you heard Teddy Wilson, and
so, Teddy Wilson is improvising, so what is it ... how did you acquire the ability to
improvise?

 By taking all (of it) from records.
(It) took me a long time to take it, because I
didnt have that quick (an) ear.
And many times, you know, play it, and then take it on
the sheet music, and then I tried to play that, as many as I could.
That is the way I
learned, mainly, the jazz language.
Also, the different tunes, you know, different....
Because there wasnt anything, books, or anything like that in those days.
Interesting


thing is, like--I said Mister Fukui, I told you about, so I was there (Beppu), and then I
moved to Fukuoka and I was in the officers club, and I did the same thing, listen to
records and take out, now... and I tried to play it on piano.
And thats how I learned.
Meanwhile, Mister Fukui sent me the book, How to Play Jazz Piano (possibly Modern
Piano Method, 1933), it was a piano kysoku hon (method book), you know, like a lesson
book, written by Vincent Lopez.
Id never heard (of him) before.
And as ... you have to
remember that Id just started, I didnt know anything about anything.
And when I think
of it now, apparently this was like a ragtime piano book, and, uh, this was the first time I
saw, what do you call, you know, stride, un-cha, un-cha, un-cha, stride.
Yeah, I saw, the
first time in my life I saw this, and it had "Twelfth Street Rag" and things like that in
there.
So, this was really exciting to me, and I was trying to play.
And, uh, Mister Fukui
much, much later, he was talking to me about his memories, which Id forgotten
completely.
He said, "I sent you a book, and a week later you sent me (it) back.
So I
thought, Maybe she didnt like it.
" And I said to him, I said, "No, I copied everything,"
so I said .... Now, when I start thinking, thats true, that happened.
So, he was really
encouraged, he probably felt like a Professor Higgins!
(laughs) Anyway, so ... that was
very exciting, doing all this.
But its mainly, learn (to) improvise or something by getting
to know the players.
In those days I had no discrimination, I copied everybody ... and,
uh, to get used to jazz language.
Then, as I mentioned earlier, on "Near You" I would try
to, you know, play my own, but not truly improvise, but it was practicing my
improvisation, and I kind of performed that, but do what I was going to do.
Something
like that.
So, by doing this, I learned a little at a time, I became my own.
I think its one
of the good things, I think about, is when you dont have a book, youre not learning from
a book.
But if you learn something from a book, you go one process, you go with the
head, then you have to digest that one.
But (if) youre doing (it) by yourself, copying a
book, copying a record and trying to play it, theres no one cushion.
So once you did
that, its already yours, digested.
I think its the hardest way but probably the best way.
Charles Mingus, when later on I was with his group, and we used to rehearse (at) his
apartment, he had no written music or anything, he sang (the melody), and you have to
remember that.
You know, I think thats the best way, to .... Small group, I guess, you
cant do that with a large ensemble (laughs).
267
 Well, I worked with Cecil, Cecil Taylor does!
(laughs)

 But thats the best way.
And, uh, my case was, thats why I say "learn by
yourself," by that .... Its always been one way, maybe, Im grappling, maybe ... it was
not so convenient a time as today, there werent any records available, you couldnt buy
them), first of all.
But, on the other hand, it was probably a good time, thats the way I
had to learn, which was probably was the best way.
So ... so, by the time when I went to
Tokyo, which was 58, I believe, somewhere....
271
 No, 58?


 No, gomen, Im sorry.
275
 48, 48.

 I think it was (19)48, uh, it was summer.
And, uh, I was a little bit, I was a
little bit, kinda, trying to play, improvise and so on and so on, you know.
When I went to
.. Mister Yamada, he was an old man, I mean an old-timer.
There were a few old
timers, Japanese old times, who used to play on the boats.
I think, one of the most
important, probably the one was (trumpeter) Mister Fumio Nanri, because (they) had a
Nanri award set up by Swing Journal.
Im the first recipient.
But, that was a long time
ago (1975)....
But anyway, he was a trumpet player.
And all those musicians were, after
the war, whenever they started they were the ones who used to be leaders of certain
groups, and so on.
There was a trombone player, played a little bit like Jack Teagarden,
and tried to sing like that, too.
That was in Tokyo.
So I really wanted to go to Tokyo,
because there wasnt anything in Fukuoka that I could learn.
And he (Yamada) gave me
an introduction letter to (one of) his old players, you know, old buddies, a drummer, his
name was Ikoma, Tokuji Ikoma, I think it was.
And also he gave me 5000 as a gift, you
know, a going-away present.
That was my monthly salary in those days.
And in those
days that was considered a very, very good salary.
And ... it was Tokyo ... there were
most, there were a lot of clubs, dance halls.
There werent any jazz clubs, its a dance
hall, and usually the top floor of a department store.
And it was one in Gotanda, it was
Shirokiya department (store), top floor, and there was a ... they were playing for the
dancers in the daytime.
I went there and ... he died several years ago, he was a drummer
called George Kawaguchi, who is very well known.
And, uh, most people dont know
that there was Teruo Yoda, he was a tenor saxophone player, and theres Fumio
Matsumoto, a trumpet player.
And they were playing.
And I thought, "Whaa...!
"
laughs), you know, "Whaa, fantastic!
" I was like watching, I was, "I wish I could play
like that!
" That was my ... so, as I say, I had introduction to....
This was a very
interesting thing about ... it was Ikoma and his band, this was a show band.
And Tokyo
station, Marunouchi side--I dont quite remember if it was six oclock, or five oclock, I
dont quite remember--but you had to be there.
Then you waited, and most of the time,
not all of the time, but most of the time there was an American truck (that) would come,
one of those khaki-colored trucks.
And we got on to that truck and went to the camps.
And, camp, there they had a show, and we had to back up, so we were a show band, so
you had to be able to sight-read.
So, I was a pretty good sight-reader in those days, you
know, so I got a job and that was ... sometimes a juggler, sometimes an opera singer
came, you know.
And I still remember, her name was Araki, I think, Miss Araki, I still
remember her face; she was a very beautiful woman.
But.
anyway, she would sing, and I
had to back up on piano.
All these things.
And the juggler was great, because the
juggler usually (was) a small-group jam session, because there was no music, other than,
usually had music and you had very little, said, "You go from here to here," blah, blah,


blah, so on and so on.
Juggler was just, "We want the tempo about like that" or
something, and we just had to....
This was (the) most, you know, fun.
279
 You were mostly jamming.

 Yeah, well, mostly, yeah, right (laughs).
I dont know how well I did, I
probably did pretty bad.
So did everybody else.
But, uh, that was ... sometimes wed go
to two different places in one night.
Go from there, go from there, something.
Sometimes no check would come and there was no job (chuckles).
Something like that.
It was kind of interesting because that was very good experience, because it was
something that you had to do at that particular moment (chuckles).
We got a job, I
should say he got a job at an officers club, St. Luke hospital at, uh ... its still there, at
Tsukiji, there was an officers club there.
And, uh, Mister Ikomas band got a job there
chuckles).
The first time I had this long dress (chuckles).
It was ... there, I had to wear
them, you know, so it looked nice or something (chuckles).
I was cursed ...
I think it was
..
I was seventeen years old at that time, maybe going on eighteen, something like that.
283
 Were you the only woman in the band?

 No.
There were no women in the band, um, there were no women in the
band.... Any woman in the band those days in Japan was a pianist.
There were no horn
players, in Japan those days.
Now, you know, now there are a few, but....
287
 Now, when you first got to Tokyo, you said you saw the band, and you said,
Oh, I want to play like them.
" What style were they playing?
Were they already
playing bebop?
Or were they playing...?

 Who?
291
 The musicians, you said, when you first got to Tokyo.

 Oh, no, no.
295
 You said, "Oh, I want to play like...."

 Those days, everything was swing style.
299
 Swing style.

 Everything was swing style.
So the drummer would play (scats), like that
chuckles).

303
 Right.

 Anyway....
307
 Can you do that again?
(laughs)

 (Laughs).
Anyway, so I was actually pretty in demand, because I was playing
like Teddy Wilson style, everything was that.
And there was a number one pianist in
those days, his name was Mister Matsui, Hachir Matsui.
He had, he was playing with a
small group, and there was another department store, the top floor, and, uh, Ikoma-san
thought I should study with him.
So he says, "Well, I dont teach, but if you want to
come watch me play, its fine.
" So off-days, which was quite often, I went to his place,
where hes playing, and it was called "Tokyo Jive" (laughs), thats the name of the group.
311
 Jive.

 It was a quintet (chuckles).
And, uh, I would sit next to him and I watched
him play.
I remember when I tried to play like that, I said, "Very soon, I will play like
Matsui-san," and Matsui-san was the leader and so I got a job with this trombone player
who had a band, in another department (store), called Isetan--its still there, though, in
Shinjuku, up there.
There was a ... this was for American people, and trombone player
was the leader, Toru Mori.
Tru Mori.
I was hired because I played like Matsui-san
laughs).
315
 (Laughs)

 Like that.
Then ... after that, I was ...
I was in a ...
I was actually, after that I
was hired (by) Tokyo Jive, because Mister Matsui got ... he had written some music that
became a hit, and he was hired by a movie company.
So I was his, you know,
predecessor (successor) or whatever (chuckles).
And so ... playing there, there was a
pianist named Akimitsu (Yoshitaka).
319
 Akimitsu?

 He came to me, he said, you know, um, "Maybe we (should) switch jobs.
"
And in those days there was a thing called "bebop," it was already in Japan.
And
grumbles), "Bebop, thats not music," something like that.
So, he was playing with a
band called Ichiban Octet...
323
 (laughs)

 ... group, and this was a bebop band.

327
 Really?

 So he really didnt want that.
He wanted to play swing style piano.
And so,
he came to me, said, you know, "Maybe we switch the piano, you play there, and I play
with this group.
" And then I said, "Well, I dont know," I mean....
But I thought, "I
shouldnt knock something that I dont even know.
I should learn, then knock!
" (laughs)
331
 (Laughs)

 So, okay, I took a job, I was the piano player with Ichiban Octet.
This was the
group that was playing in the Shinagawa depot.
This was the first, this was
predominantly black people.
I think maybe it was a sergeants club, Im not quite sure.
335
 You said, where was it?
Shinagawa?

 Shinagawa.
And there was a ... today Shinagawa ... today, its the east side,
which is the ocean side, there was nothing there.
Today it is the most hip place.
Even
Dean & Deluca has a store (there).
Its like a really upscale, and uh, (as) famous here as
the Oyster Bar in the station, (Grand) Central Station, they have a restaurant over there,
the east side.
But in those days there was nothing there.
And then, from that side, there
was this club.
339
 And the name of the club again?

 I dont remember.
As I said, this club is the ... the Ichiban Octet--I dont
even know if it had a name, because it was for the Americans, as I said, it was all black
musicians, I mean, excuse me, troops....
343
 Black soldiers.

 Soldiers.
Every once in a while I saw white soldiers, but it couldve been a
sergeants club, Im not quite sure.
But it was something to do with shipping, something
depot.
347
 Quartermasters depot?

 Yes, thats it, quartermaster depot.
351
 Now, you mentioned a club, or a camp before, was that Camp Zama that you ....

 No.

355
 ...said the truck used to come and get you?
What was that?
Remember, you
said you guys would wait for the truck to come and get you and take you to a camp?

 I have no idea where they were.
359
 (Laughs) Okay.

 But I know it was in Tokyo.
And as I mentioned, I said it would go from one
place to another sometimes.
363
 Yeah.

 So, Im not quite sure where they were.
I have no idea.
I dont even know
where Zama is even today.
367
 (Chuckles)

 But, so, that was, this was a totally different, one place and so on.
This band
was my very first bebop band, and they had like, uh, Illinois Jacquet playing, it was
called "Jet Propulsion.
" And he solos, you know, and the introduction was piano, da-
DAH da-da-da-da-da-da-dan-dan-dan, something like that.
Anyway, this was the first
time I really felt like I was in a jazz band.
It was really exciting and we had "A Night in
Tunisia," "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," all these stock arrangements.
371
 Mmmm!

 And there was a black trumpet player--I dont remember the name, I dont
really think I knew the name--he was, every once and a while, he rehearsed (with) the
group.
It was an octet, it was led by an old timer, hes a tenor saxophone player, his
name was Shin Matsumoto--um, Shintar, Shintar?
(repeats, Shin Matsumoto is correct)--I dont
quite remember his ... first name, but last name was Shin Matsumoto Matsumoto, he was an old timer.
He
was considered the "Coleman Hawkins of Japan" (laughs).
But it was playing ... that
was very, very exciting, it was like this particular one had stock arrangements, so they
had, like, the solo was always, you know, someone who played it, it was already written.
And Matsumoto-san would play this Illinois Jacquet solo.
It sounded so hip to me--
wow, thats fantastic!
(laughs).
375
 So you had tenor saxophone, trumpet, uh....

 Tenor saxophone, trumpet, and there was a G.I., Japanese American--I dont
quite remember, I see the face--alto saxophone (probably James Araki) He was the


saxophone, and the one with the glasses, I dont remember the name, he was the trumpet
player.
Then there was a ... tenor saxophone.
There was a guitar.
The guitar player and
I had a fight, so thats how I remember the guitar player (laughs).
379
 (Laughs).
What did you fight about?

 Ah, I dont remember, I think it was I never liked the guitar, you know, they
always kinda ... very difficult to play together, unless you have some kind of
understanding.
And of course I was immature, Im sure he was immature, too.
So we
had a lot of problems.
But it was ... the drummer ...
I wish I remembered the alto
players name, but he was a Japanese American, I think from Hawaii, I dont remember.
But there was, I think, it was an octet, maybe there was a couple of trumpet players,
possibly.
I dont remember, I dont remember whether this trumpet player wore glasses,
then alto, the lead alto, and Matsumoto-san was the tenor saxophone player.
There was a
guitar and drums ... drummer and the bass player I dont remember who they were,
either.
But, uh....
383
 Did they really capture the bebop style?

 Bebop style?
Probably.
I dont know.
I dont remember anything, besides
the fact that I was just introduced to it and I couldnt tell one way or another, probably
chuckles).
The first bebop players, at that time, there was young musicians, together
they were called CB9, for some reason.
They were playing in Yokohama.
And they
were the ... Jun Shimizu, he was the first bebop player, one of those, you know, broken
rhythm, he was the first one.
And, uh, Im not quite sure, but I couldnt probably tell in
those days if it was bebop or not.
I wasnt even in a position to criticize anyone
chuckles).
387
 Had you heard, uh, Charlie Parker or Dizzy Gillespie records by this time?

 No, I hadnt.
But they used to sing in "Oo-Pa-Pa-Da," dah-da-da-dah,
something like that, so on and so on.
So, still, I hadnt even heard Bud Powell.
That was
still.... Then after this ...
I was asked to play in another band, called Gay Stars
chuckles), thats a big band.
Then there was another one, this was called Six Lemons.
It
was Six Lemons ... by this time, I was really copying things--by the time when I went to
Six Lemons, there were jazz coffee shops sprouting in all places--and around those
times, I heard Bud Powell.
391
 About what year is this now, maybe fift--.

 I would say 50.
I would say 50, 51.
I would think 51.
But there was an
Armed Forces Radio Service, they had a jazz hour, and I heard this "Body and Soul" and


its beautifully played, and I said, "Wow, who could that be?
" and that was Bud Powell.
Since then, I tried to listen to him, and pretty much the same time there was a jazz coffee
shop, you know.
Those days, records were costing--I think it was the black market, you
could only buy in the black market--it was 3000.
And those days if you were a
graduate of an Ivy (League) college and got a job in a bank, the first salary was 6000 in
Japan, monthly, you know.
So you know how expensive the records were.
So these were
probably bought on the black market from a PX who would buy....
So my learning place
was the jazz coffee shop, and I went there and listened to records and tried to learn the
tunes.
And by that time there were many Bud Powell records and so on.
And the place I
went most was a in Yokohama, a place called Chigusa.
Its gone but....
The owner of
Chigusa (Yoshida Mamoru), he actually received a medal from Yokohama city, as a
contributor to the cultural scene of Yokohama, something like that.
He died quite some
time ago (1994).
But most jazz coffee shops were very small; this one was particularly
small, maybe like six people, be like, thats it.
395
 (Chuckles)

 And I would listen to records.
And uh, you know, as I said before, you cant
copy by (listening) one time only, so I would have to ask her, ask him, I said, "Im sorry,
but could you play that please again?
" and he would say, "Yes!
" and he would do that,
and I tried....
So, you know, this is the LP time, so probably quite a lot of his records at
one point were pretty, went down!
(laughs)
399
 (Chuckles)

 But those were very, very important school, you know, places for me, or
somebody like ... now, this was, I have another place about, away from here, its a little
small house that I work there, because theres nothing there, you know, no telephone or
anything, thats where I usually go to work.
But I put it there, but there was.... Quite
some time ago, I still had a large ensemble, and someplace, it could be Indiana, Im not
quite sure, (there was) a concert.
The presenter came to me and said, "I have a surprise
for you, somebody wants to present you something.
" And this man came with a sketch of
me.
He sketched while I was listening to records (laughs).
403
 At the coffee shop?

 Yes, coffee shop.
So he gave this to me and its in a corner in my, you know,
other place.
But, that was a ... coffee cost, I think, 50 in those days, you know, so you
had one coffee then you stay there three hours or something, chart another tune, or so on
and so on.
407
 (Chuckles)



 And Bud Powell record was ... the first one, I think he was 23 years old, his
first (as a) leader.
And my first recording, which was done by Norman Granzz, you know,
at the recommendation from the late <span class="fullMatch" id="match_53">Oscar Peterson</span>, I was 23 years old, so I thought,
Whoa, this is something!
" (laughs)
411
 (Laughs) Lets go back to when you first got to Tokyo, um, about your
impressions of Tokyo, and where you first stayed.
Did you have any con ... you had this
letter of introduction,

 Yes.
415
 you had a job....

 No, no, no.
419
 ...but did you have a place to stay?
How did you, what was your social
situation?

 My mothers friend was quite wealthy, they had a house in Setagaya, and
uh....
423
 Where?

 Setagaya, which is like, uh ... here it would be, say, oh....
427
 Well, I have a map of Tokyo, would it be...?

 Yes, Setagaya-ku (ward), yes.
Setagaya-ku is a more residential area.
They
have a densha (train) from Shibuya station to, on the way to Yokohama.
431
 Oh, Shibuya.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

 They had a house, so I had one room upstairs they rented to me.
So, those
days ... later, yeah, I also left there and went to other places.
But its always, those days
I was always renting one room or the upstairs.
Later on, before, maybe a year before I
came to this country, I was in Shinagawa, and upstairs.... See, in those days, after the
war was ended, many, relatively wealthy people lost income, so they rented out rooms for
the income.
So there was quite a lot of those, yknow.
And, uh, the last one I had, they
converted so there was a kitchen upstairs, and things like that.
435
 So you actually didnt have a piano in your house where you lived.


 No.
I did not have a piano til, uh, when I was in the Blue Coats Orchestra, so
that would be 50, 1950, I think.
I think I went to Tokyo in 48, so didnt have any....
But 1950 I was asked to join what was called the Blue Coats Orchestra, and theyre more
like....
439
 Blue Coats?

 Blue Coats, you know, right.
And it was funny ... they were very much in a
Les Brown bag kind of thing, more like a dance band, like a middle-of-the-road kind of
thing, and they had ... they asked me to join the orchestra, and my condition was, "Give
me an advance and I can buy a piano.
" So thats what I did.
Thats the first time I had
my (own) upright piano.
And (at) that time I was renting a room that was six mattress
size), you know, rokuj, we call it.
And, uh, I had a piano and I had a bed and it was
very exciting to me (laughs gaily).
443
 You remember what kind?

 Uh, it was called Bruckner.
I think it was called Bruckner.
And, uh ... it
really didnt matter to me, whatever, it was okay.
But that was called Bruckner and....
Soon after I bought the piano, the Blue Coats were playing at a Yokohama place, a
civilian club, called the Colonial Club, called Club Colonial, a civilian club.
Les Brown
and Bob Hope came for a USO tour and they played at the stadium in Yokohama and uh
.. for the Americans, you know, you (Japanese) couldnt get in there.
But I kind of
snuck in there (laughs).
Anyway, I got to know the pianist, I think his name was Jeff
Clarkson.
I think his brother used to play with Gene Krupas trio, and I think he was the
brother.
I think he was called Jeff Clarkson.
I asked him to come and play for us.
And
he came to my little place.
We all were kind of excited--I wasnt the only one, there
were others and so on--and he played my piano, you know.
It was "I Got You (My Love
to) Keep Me Warm" or something like that (sings)....
447
 "Ive Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.
"

 ...and its got a little piano solo.
I used to play just like that (laughs).
It was
very good, thats the first piano I had, very, very exciting.
451
 So, that means now youre working at the Colonial Club in Yokohama.
Are you
still working with..., are you working in many bands at this time?

 No, I moved from one band to another quite, probably three months at a time.
The longest one probably I was--that is, in Tokyo--the longest one probably was maybe
around six months, it was the first band, maybe ... God, uh ... maybe about that much


with the Ichiban Octet.
But most of the time three months with the Blue Coats to Gay
Stars.
After Gay Stars there was a small combo called Six Lemons.
This was....
455
 Six Lemons?
(chuckles)

 Six Lemons.
These were supposed to be the best young players.
There were
no jazz clubs and there was a new nightclub, which opened in Ginza.
The manager
was--I forgot the name--he was supposed to be the nightclub manager, and he wanted to
have all the best young musicians together, a sextet, for playing.
And he was asked by ...
I mentioned before, Yoda, Teruo Yoda, who was a tenor saxophonist and played quite
well--he was more like, somewhere between Flip Phillips and, uh, a little like ... you
know, that kind of style, kind of....
So he gathered the musicians and I was elected as the
piano player.
And so we were there.
The drummers name was Frankie Sakai; later on
he became an actor, a movie actor, he actually was quite good at it, he got some kind of
award.
He died quite some time ago.
But he was a natural comedian and there was a
song called "Orange Colored Sky," something like that, and he sang.
And I really hated
it.
So he and I had a big fight (laughs), and I left in the middle of the....
In those days I
had a hot temper.
And, uh, I left and I went back, this was a different place, where I had
a room rented.
And I heard something in the window, I heard Yoda Teruo Yoda, he said,
Apologize to her.
Apologize to her.
Shes only a woman.
" (laughs heartily) But
anyway, this was a sextet, we played, and that time--Im sure it was (19)50--the
nightclubs in Japan, there were always girls, you know, beautifully dressed girls around
and da-da-da, and thats when Oscar Pettiford came with his troops to play (at) that Ernie
Pyle theater.
And the Ernie Pyle theater, you (Japanese) couldnt get in, but by that time
Id developed my, what do you call, okkake, here they call ... they call, you know, people
who follow you, fans, not a fan, but you have another word for it....
459
 Not a stalker?
(laughs)

 No.
I will think of it in a minute.
So we call it okkake in Japan.
463
 Like devotee?
No?

 No, uh, groupie.
467
 Groupie!
Okay (chuckles).

 I had groupies, I had American groupies, and they would come ... you know,
this was a Japanese club so Americans are not supposed to be there.
So I had these
groupies, about four of them, they were in the backstage and listening.
And this club,
downstairs there was a coffee shop, Japanese coffee shops are usually restaurants.
Every
once in a while the MPs would come.
So MPs would come, and they would go


downstairs (laughs).
So they were the groupies.
One of the groupies, his nickname ...
we used to call him "Mac," because his whole full name was McCutchen--I dont quite
remember the first name (Harry), but McCutchen--and he was an Air Force sergeant or
something and he was a jazz fan and one of the groupies.
And he told me about Oscar
Pettifords group, and that he would take me to backstage.
And he took me to backstage
and I saw ... this was the first time in my life I saw people warming up.
You know, Id
never seen that, Japanese players (were) never warming up.
And ... J.J. Johnson ... this
group was Oscar Pettiford, J.J. Johnson, Howard McGhee, Rudy Williams, who I didnt
know then, there was (drummer) Charlie Rice, and there was a guitar player (Skeeter
Best).
And because it was a USO tour, they didnt have a pianist.
But I heard J.J.
warming up and that really impressed me, and McKutchen, Mac, said, "Well, this is
Toshiko Akiyoshi, a pianist," and they said, "Oh, hi, excuse me, I have to warm up," and
you know, so.... That was really my first ... "Wow," you know, "a great player like that,
playing a long tone.
" And uh, so I asked ... by the time I was listening to them my job
had already started.
I could tell Yoda-san was steaming mad that "the pianist is not
here.
" And so I asked them to come to where I worked, it was a nightclub.
So ... J.J.,
Oscar Pettiford--I, actually I have a picture somewhere--but anyway, Howard McGhee,
they came, so naturally Yoda-san was very mad, but I came with them so I was forgiven,
so to speak.
And we had a little jam session.
But when I played--at that time I played, I
think I played, probably, "Squatty Roo," I have a feeling I probably played "Squatty
Roo.
" And J.J. said, "Ah, so you like Bud Powell!
" And uh, I really loved Miles Davis,
you know (mumbles), I said, "Hows Miles doing?
" He said, "Oh, you like Miles Davis, huh?
Hes not working.
" (laughs) This was, like, 1950.
I dont think he was working.
That
was ... those (guys) were the American jazz scene.
The fact is, when I came (to
America) in 56 and in 57, I was at the Hickory House for six weeks.
Oscar Pettiford
used to come almost every night and sit in.
And that was the greatest lesson you could
ever have.
On the other hand, when you think about that, why he could come almost
every night, (it was) because he wasnt working.
You know, nowadays if he was, today
people would pay a premium to listen to him.
So those were the days, I think, in a way.
471
 J.J. didnt explain why Miles wasnt working?
Did he give any indication why?

 No, he just said, "Hes not working," thats all.
Anyway, there werent that
many jobs, probably, because Oscar Pettiford, it was the same thing much later, like six,
seven years later.
But, um, that time ...
I started thinking about that I really didnt want
to play in a dance band, you know, dance music.
You had to play dance music, of
course, thats what it was for.
So I made my own group.
I quit and I made my own
quartet and ... how I named it, I said it was small, so I named it the Cozy Quartet.
So it
was called Cozy Quartet, first one.
That was my first one.
And, uh, til then I was the
top-paid sideman, sideperson, player in Japan, I was getting 50,000, which today ... if I
were a little clever, if I were a little more, better minded person rather than just thinking
of playing, playing, playing, I wouldve bought land.
Id have been a billionaire today


laughs).
475
 (laughs)

 But its okay.
Everything works out.
But it was, I just ... that was a departure
for me.
And after that, I had a very difficult time, you know, economically at that time.
But, I didnt stop, so I was somehow ... since then, most of the time, I would start
playing at a place like a service club, because you could play (jazz), and my best job was
in Yokohama, a place called Seamens Club.
And it was a small ... it was a seamens
club.
Almost once a week they had a fight, you know, a big fight.
The owner, I think,
was a Marine lawyer or something, American, who was married to a Japanese.
The lady
was a beautiful lady, used to be an old titled familys daughter.
Anyway, and sometimes
the owner would try to stop a fight, and it was (?
?, laughs), it was horrible, it was awful.
But you could play anything you want.
And that was an important place, because it was
in Yokohama.
Yokohama had a (military) camp.
Thats where Hampton Hawes was.
And not only that, there was Hal Stein, who later on was with Charles, Ray Ch..., not
Ray Charles, uh, the vibraphone player, the Teddy Charles....
479
 Teddy Charles.

 ...group.
And Buddy (Walter) Benton, who no one knew (in) those days, but
played really good, you know.
And he was the one who used to show me the tunes, like
Indiana.
" I didnt know the tune, its like, "Back home Indiana," all those tunes I
learned from what we called "Saig-san," you know, he looked like Saig (Takamori,
famous samurai leader of the Meiji Restoration)-san .
So, that was a very important place
for me and uh, everything, anything.... And also, going home, Id stop at Chigusa and
listen to records and (have) coffee, and so on and so on.
And that was very, very, you
know, important.
Before that, I have to mention about 53, 1953 I already had my own
group, as I said, sometimes (wed) get a job, I dont have a job, and then I would just be
by) myself.
And there was a very popular group called Six Joes.
483
 Six Joes.

 Six Joes.
And there was, uh, the leader was a bass player named Shin
Watanabe.
He later on formed Shin Watanabe Productions, the production (company).
If it
werent for that production (company), you couldnt have any television program,
something like that.
It really became... and he was a bass player, and he also died, but
the tenor player was one of the best, actually, probably one of the two best tenor players,
this one we used to call "Sleepy," because he looked like he was sleeping all the time.
It
was Hidehiko Matsumoto ... maybe, I dont quite remember ... Hidehiko Hidehiko Matsumoto.
Hidehiko Matsumoto.
And he was a tenor player, and he was a very, very counted player.
And there was a
vibraphone player, then there was ... anyway, Six Joes, so it was the most popular group.

Then, 1953, the first live house, jazz club in Tokyo, and....
487
 Live house?

 Yeah, live house, the first one.
Um....
491
 Where was it in Tokyo?

 Theyre called "live houses" in Japan.
495
 Where was it in Tokyo?
What section?

 West, Ginza.
Ginza, nana-chme, roku-chme (city block 7 or 6), second one,
roku-chme (block 6).
Ginza is seven chme, but the second one, and the west side of the
main street.
Main street of Ginza, west side, and uh.... (It) opened October 15.
The man
asked the Six Joes, you know, Watanabe-san, to play the (opening) night, and there was a
charge of music, another was, he was ... daytime.
So he came to me--he always liked
my playing--and he said, "You get the best ones you want to get," you know, maybe like
a quintet to play in the daytime.
I played from, like, 12 to 6 or something.
And he
Watanabe) played from 7 to 11, something like that, I dont know ... Im not quite sure
of accurate hours, daytime.
I had an evening, already had a job, and I had a quartet, and
thats the first time Sadao Watanabe, who is very famous today, he was maybe 18 years
old, and I had him.
He was the first one who sounded like a bebop player.
He sounded
very much like Jackie McLean, that kind of sound, you know.
Anyway, so ... when
Shin) Watanabe-san asked me to do it, Sadao Watanabe was a little bit too ... its not
quite, quite ... so at that time there was a more established alto player and there was
another tenor player who played very well, Miyazawa, Akira Miyazawa, who was also
very a good player and had a quintet in the daytime.
So, November 3, I dont remember,
 2, 3, or 2, 3, 4, or 3, 4, 5, I dont remember, but three days, Norman Granzz brought
<span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_881_622907">JATP</span> (Jazz at the Philharmonic) to Japan and played the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_881_622883">Nichigeki</span>, which no longer
exists, but in Yrakuch.
This was the first group that came to Japan to play for a
Japanese audience.
Before that, there was, I said, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_92">Oscar Pettiford</span>s group, and the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_883_624284"><span class="fullMatch" id="match_93">Gene
Krupa</span> <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_885_46">Trio</span></span> was there, and actually, Louis Armstrongs group was there, too.
But they were all
USO tours.
499
 USO tours.

 So, this was the first one.
And, uh, Oscar Petersons trio, and Ella Fitzgerald,
you know, and all these ... Flip Phillips, Ben Webster, I think was there, I dont know.
But Roy Eldridge, and Charlie Shavers, I think.
But, anyway, they came and played.
And someone brought--I wish I know who that is, because I couldnt possibly, how I can
thank him, I dont know, but (he was) Japanese, I know--he brought Oscar Peterson and


Flip Phillips to this live house when I was playing.
And we ... so he listened to (me) a
bit and came to me while I was playing and said, "Are you playing somewhere tonight?
"
and I said, "Yes, Im playing dah-dah-dah-dah," and he said, "Okay, Ill come again,
because I have to go to work now.
" Then he came again (in the) evening, to a place that
was called Club New Ginza, it was mostly for the Americans, and it was kind of like a ...
balcony, stairs, you know.
And he came and he listened and he played, too, he played,
too.
And he said, "I want you to come at three oclock to the hotel," and I said .... And
he ... told <span class="fullMatch" id="match_103">Norman Granzzz</span>, he said, "You should record her.
" Thats how my recording came, you
know.
And ... this is also like, say, luck was involved, I think, in timing, because if the
live house wasnt open, he would not have (had) an opportunity to listen to me.
So
everything is kind of timing, you know.
So I consider myself very lucky that the place
was open at that time and that I was asked by Watanabe-san to have my group play, you
know, quote-unquote "all-star," you know (chuckles), quintet, whatever it is.
So,
everything I think had a lot to do with timing, and luck was involved, you know.
503
 Before we go on to your recording, um, who else was in the rhythm section of
your quintet, this "all-star" quintet?

 Youre talking of ... my ...?
507
 The one that you got together....

 Oh, there was a ... drummer and bass player were from my quartet....
511
 From your quartet?

 My quartet, yes....
515
 So who were the original personnel of your quartet, your first group?

 Quartet is ... Jun Kawaguchi--he also died, he was a young man, but--he was
then a bass player.
We used to call (him) "Omasuzu," thats his nickname.
And he
couldnt really understand, you know, the things ...
I had to write it, all the notes, so its
the kind of right notes to play....
519
 So you had to write out all the walking bass (lines)?
Everything?
(laughs)

 Yeah, all the walking bass, cause he wasnt a walking bass player.
I dont
really know how many walking bass players existed in those days, you know.
But, uh, at
least there was somebody--Watanabe-san was (one of them)--they understand the
chord) changes and so on.
This man didnt quite understand everything.
So ... and I
had my particular way I wanted to hear.
I didnt want to hear certain notes.
So I,


consequently I had to write all the notes (laughs).
523
 (Laughs) You have to write everything you want to hear!

 Yeah, right, exactly.
So, that was a ... so everything, I think, all had to do
with the timing.
527
 Yeah, absolutely.
So ... Oscar Peterson recommends to Norman Granz that he
should record you.
So then what happens?
So you met Norman Granz, at this point?
Yeah.

 Yes, I met ... he said, "I usually listen to a player before I record it, but Oscar Peterson
said that I dont have to listen to you.
We have to go to Hong Kong, but a week later
well) come back, so you select the music by that time," and so on.
And, uh, we
recorded from midnight, "Ill give you Oscar Petersons rhythm section," which was that ... and of
course Oscar Peterson didnt have drummer, so JATP--in Oscar Petersons trio there wasnt any
drummer--so JATP had, J.C. Herd was the drummer.
So J.C. Herd, and Herb Ellis, and
Ray Brown, that was the rhythm section.
531
 So how was that?

 I dont really remember, I think I was like this (probably makes a face), of
course.
535
 (Laughs)

 I really didnt think I could play, you know.
But once we started playing it
was okay.
But ... he would say, "Play six choruses," like that, and I have no problem
playing those--I used to play 20 minutes, wah-wah-wah-wah, you know.
And, uh ... one
thing about the Norman Granzz recording is that--I didnt think about it in those days, but
later on I thought about--now, who am I?
Ray Brown, Herb Ellis, you know, J.C. Herd,
I mean they were like real giants of jazz players.
They have nothing to play; <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_916_51">Norman Granzzz</span>
wouldnt let them take any solos or nothing.
Its all piano.
All piano.
Thats the way he
liked to record.
So, he liked to record someone, if hes featuring somebody, he features
somebody, thats it.
If you notice about Oscar Peterson trio recordings, its pretty much
like that, you know.
539
 Feature the, yeah....

 Yeah, thats how....
543
 Well, Im looking at the discography entry for your ... Amazing Toshiko


Akiyoshi.
Thats the title of the record (laughs).

 Is it?
No, Amazing, I dont think that was the one, though.
I think the first one
was a 10-inch (LP), the pink ... the cover, (there was) a flower coming out of the piano.
547
 Hmm (chuckles).

 Is that what it says, Amazing?
551
 Well, thats what it is in this, this is the Tom Lord discography.
It has the listing
of tunes.
First tune that is listed is "Toshikos Blues.
"

 See, that is Norman's fault.
555
 (Laughs)

 Because that is a Bud Powell ... a Bud Powell ... (sings) da-da-da-da-da-dahh, Bud Powell played
that one.
559
 Uh-huh.

 I think its called "Buds Blues" (composed by Sonny Stitt).
But probably he
didnt copyright it.
563
 Ahh.

 So <span class="fullMatch" id="match_119">Norman Granzzz</span> gave me credit, which I got ... you know, I needed that like a hole
in the head, everybody thinks I stole it.
But I had nothing to do with anything.
That was
really a drag.
567
 So did you pick all the tunes, all the tunes that were recorded?

 Yes, yes.
571
 So this is your repertoire, then.

 Yes, yes.
575
 And you have "Squatty Roo"....

 Yes.

579
 ... "Laura," "Shadrach," "I Want to be Happy," "What is this Thing Called
Love?
" What were ... so when you got ready to make this recording, can you describe
the process?
You have these other three, as you say, great jazz musicians.
So whats the
process?
You just get into the studio and just play, or did you rehearse, or did you talk
about the tunes?

 No, we never rehearsed.
We just went there and played.
So he just ... he
didnt like to take many takes, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_121">Norman Granzzz</span>, you know.
Hed just say, "Play once," then he
would say, "You play six choruses," like that.
And some had a bridge--some music
doesnt have a bridge, but some tunes have a bridge--sometimes the bridge was taken by
the drummer or something like that.
But other than that, there was no one, no one played
solos.
583
 How was the feeling with the other musicians, how...?

 Oh, they were very supportive.
Of course, they knew how nervous I was, you
know.
So ... they were very, very, very supportive.
Im grateful for that.
And its just
uh ...
I dont really remember anything, because I really nervous, and I was like that.
But, I was playing a lot before that, you know, before this happened, so I had no problem
playing, and once youre playing its fine, but before youre playing, you get really
nervous.
But it was, you know ... so, it went like that and.... Lew Tabackin, sometime, a long
time ago, first time he listened to that record, he said, "Boy, you used to play very fast!
"
chuckles)
587
 (Laughs)

 Yeah, I used to play very fast (chuckles).
591
 I know that you mentioned, you know, the lineage of Teddy Wilson and Bud
Powell.
What about Art Tatum?
Does he figure in?

 <span class="fullMatch" id="match_127">Art Tatum</span> was something that was ... when Norman Granzz, after recording,
he went back to the States and he sent me tons of Art Tatums (records), because he
recorded for (Granz), so he sent them to me.
And ... his recording ... actually, frankly
speaking, I neglected to say, but I heard his record before that, playing, uh, "Begin the
Beguine.
" And, uh, I think it was, I heard it at a jazz coffee shop, and it was really
amazing technique, the way ... and I think I sort of was....
But also, I heard "Elegy.
"
This is a masterpiece.
I mean, I ... Im not the only one: apparently Norman Granzz...
I
mean, excuse me, Oscar Peterson really thought so.
I understand he used to play that,
you know.
I have no chops to play that, but I mean, Oscar Peterson has and he used to play that all
the time.
And Ray Brown used to kid him and say, "Hey, hey, Oscar Peterson," you know,
Art Tatum is here!
" And he would say, "Oo-oo," and stop or something.
It made him feel


like that, (so) Art Tatum must have been really great.
I didnt get to hear him in person.
But
most recordings, it was really ...
I was amazed (at) his ability, and he would play one
after another, and if I know Norman Granzz, he probably didnt have a take two,
everything blah, blah, blah, and it was so many standard tunes and so on.
But, it didnt
really hit my heart.
The one who hit (my) heart was Bud Powell.
He was the one, you
know, who really hit my heart.
He not only had enormous technique--later I learned that
he was actually classically trained, which I didnt know that--but his ... his ... uh ...
actuation, he had a very unique way of accenting a certain beat.
It was a very ... his
own.
Although hes not exactly a smooth player, he was really ... and he was real
dynamic.
But he also ... he was another tree, family tree from Art Tatum.
He came out
directly from Charlie Parker, so hes basically the first bebop player, so he played very
much, his early ... if you listen, its very much like Charlie Parker, except he doesnt
have to breathe, you know.
595
 (Laughs)

 But he had ... and I really love the way he played ballads.
He was such, hes
got such a male romance and inborn ability, and I always thought, (swooning voice) "Oh,
beautiful, ahhhh!
" (chuckles)
599
 (Chuckles) So were you happy with the recording once you heard it back, your
first recording?
I mean, cause now this is your document.

 No, I had no feeling whatsoever.
603
 (Laughing) Just numb, huh?

 Yeah.
All I know was, it sent me ... the review, I think it was Down Beat,
said I had three stars, which I think was pretty good, you know, first one.
And the cover
got five stars!
(laughs)
607
 (Laughs) The flowers coming out of the piano?

 Yeah, yeah, yeah!
(laughs)
611
, Okay, um, (recording engineer interrupts) ... okay, sure.
Break time.
Look, the
suns out!
Amazing!
....
Returning again.
While we were on break, we were talking
about the possibility of..., while Toshiko was performing in the clubs in Tokyo, its
entirely possible, my mother was a native of Tokyo, Shinagawa, and my father was
stationed there, and thats where they met, it was dancing in those service clubs.
Its
entirely possible that my parents met while Toshiko was performing (laughs)!


 Yeah!
Its entirely possible (laughs).
615
 I think thats extraordinary.
Um, Ill definitely have to tell my mom about that
laughs).
So ... youve done your first recording now, uh, youve gotten, this is your first
exposure in America, youve gotten a review by Down Beat.
So what happens next?

 Nothing happens.
619
 (Laughs)

 (Laughs) Actually, after that, my life was the same as before: I was still barely
paying the rent, and so on and so on.
And, meanwhile, as I said before, there were a lot
of American troops were drafted and stationed in Japan, and one of the persons was from
Boston.
And his name was Tony Teixeira--I understand hes also deceased--but he was
a guitar player.
And he said, "You know, you should write a school, theres a Berklee
School of Music, and you should write, maybe they can bring you over to the States.
"
And I really wanted to go to the States, for the reason, cause Id been copying the music
from records and Im listening to players, and by 52 or 3, Id become sort of like the
biggest, you know, frog in a very small pond, so to speak.
And then I couldnt really ...
as you know, jazz is a social art: if you are surrounded by better players, you become
better at it.
So, at this particular point, maybe I was the biggest frog in a small pond, but I
was just starting.
I was just ... there were so many things that I wanted to be able to play
with these players whose records Id been listening to all the time.
And it would be great
if I went to the States, Id be able to play with them, Id be able to learn much more and
blah, blah, blah.
So, I had written a letter--Im sure it was terrible English (laughs)--but
I got (it) proofed by, it was the guitar player, Tony Teixeira read it and he said, "Well, I guess its
okay," you know, "Its fine.
" And ... at almost the same time, thats when my record
came out, also, 1954, I believe, and so on.
So ... the school was like about 350 students,
its not like today.
And the founder was Lawrence Berk, Mister Berk was probably
looking for something to advertise the school, and uh, here comes the record, my record.
And in those days, if you said a Japanese plays jazz, it was like, something as if,
REALLY?
" You know, you couldnt believe from today.
Especially if it was a girl.
And its really like, uh ... and Norman Granzz recorded it.
So there was a lot of reason
for people to maybe pay attention, what have you.
So the school, basically, gave me a
full scholarship (to) advertise the school.
And in those days you couldnt come to the
States unless you had a student visa or a working visa, one or the other.
And uh ...
I still
remember the student visa was called an F-form visa, something.
Anyway, that finalized
.. and in 56, January, I came to this country.
It was Pan-American number one.
623
 (Chuckling) Okay.

 Four-propeller engine.

627
 How many days did it take?
I know when I first went to Japan it took three
days: first from San Francisco to Hawaii, then to Wake Island (laughs).
How long, what
was your trip?

 You know, I cant remember, but Im sure there were bom, bom, bom (many
stops).
What I remember about it is that there was hardly anyone on the plane.
631
 Mmm.

 And it was three seats, three seats.
And I was ... also, stewardesses were very
kind, not like today.
Today its like army surgeon or something....
But they were very,
very kind, and there were just not many people.
That I remember.
And ... what I
remember is from, it was Los Angeles to Boston--Im sure it stopped many places--but
I was sleeping and I woke up one day, landed and take off and so on, blah, blah.
And I
got into Boston at two oclock in the morning, Sunday morning.
January, Im not quite
sure, 11th or 10th, somewhere around there.
But it was a long trip, I know.
But it was
very exciting to me.
Id never flown before, so... (chuckles).
635
 I want to talk about your experience: at this time, was it still called Schillinger
House, or was it already called Berklee?

 It was called Berklee School of Music, because Schillinger House--and Mrs.
Schillinger objected to that, to use the Schillinger name--so Mr. Berk changed it to
Berklee.
Lee was his son, who is already retired.
When I went to school he was a little
boy.
And uh ... so Berk-lee School of Music.
639
 Um, Im going to return us back to Japan, because there was something that was
written about you and your days in Japan, in Hampton Hawes autobiography....

 Ah, ah, ah.
643
 ...called Raise Up Off Me.
And page 62, hes talking about, he was talking to a
woman, a Japanese woman, and she says, "Ill take you to the Harlem Club, wheres
theres a girl, Toshiko, plays like Bud Powell.
" So, um, the Harlem Club, could you talk
about that?
Do you remember the Harlem Club?

 Well, what I remember is that there was a bass player called Nabil Totah.
647
 Uh-huh, "Knobby" Totah, yeah, yeah.
Arabian.

 He was active ... it was Yokohamas, stationed in Yokohama, Im not quite....


Either 293rd Army Band, or 289th Army Band, I dont know which one, which.
But it
was ... he told me, said, "You know, Hampton Hawes is coming.
We are trying to get
him into our camp.
" So, to make the story short, so he came.
And, those days we had a
lot of sessions, jam sessions at night.
So he came to sessions.
And, as you know, he was
very sick, and he would play, and that was my first meeting with Hamp, was that session,
that time.
Then it was ... his job was in the Army Band, because there was no piano--
those days, the boats came in to the harbor at Yokohama that the band had to play for,
and his job was to play cymbals (laughs).
651
 (Laughs)

 I dont know how well he played the cymbals, but that was his job.
And uh, at
that time I mentioned that I was playing at the Yokohama Seamens Club, so he used to
come down and I asked him to play and he would play.
And I would listen to him play
and try to learn a lot, as much as I could.
It was because, you know, probably the first
noted musician as far as ... because before that there was Shelly Manne, I think it was
Shorty Rogers, probably was the leader, the writer.
They called them something "Giants"
Shorty Rogers and His Giants) or something, something, an L.A. band, it was a group.
They played and Hamp played a solo ...
I dont quite remember the tune (sings),
something like that, you know.
And he had such a crispy way of playing, you know, his
touch was very crispy, it was very, his own.
It was fantastic, and so here is the person I
heard on the record, and here he is in Yokohama, and I tried to learn as much as I could.
It was a pity, the fact that he was very sick while he was in the camp, still.
So he had a
lot of problems, you know.
He was probably one of the sweetest men that I probably
have met.
And in later years--much later, much later--and I was in an apartment that
was in Greenwich Village, 10th street, and he got an engagement at the, uh, the Village
Vanguard, for two weeks.
And it was very ... he hadnt played in New York in a long,
long, long time, and he came to visit me, and he had a new recording, with strings
Hampton Hawes Plays Movie Musicals, recorded 1969).
And he came to visit me, he
wanted to give it to me.
But he had his record in newspaper, to cover (it) up.
Now, most
players, they will show people, so that they can see it!
He was kind of like that; he was a
very sweet person, and he wasnt, you know, an aggressive person, and uh, he was a very
unique (in his) playing.
I think he influenced a lot of people and I am among those.
It
was great that he came to Yokohama!
(laughs)
655
 Hm, well, he described seeing you, he said, and Im quoting: "...then this little
chick in a kimono (chuckles) sat down at the piano and started to rip off things I didnt
believe, swinging like shed grown up in Kansas City.
" So, you obviously made a big
impression on him, and then he goes on to discuss, he said that you guys became very,
very good friends, very close friends, and then he says that you went on to America and
made it big.
But he says he has--let me see if I can read it--uh, "Toshiko...," oh geez,
Im sorry....
Uh, he talks about a possibility of you two doing duets and what he says is


that it didnt happen.
Uh, "Later on she made it on her own in the States.
Anyway I soon
discovered she dug me for myself and we developed a lasting friendship.
The American
consulate arranged for us to play a concert together and the response was so good, they
contacted the Army to see about sending us on tour--Toshiko in her kimono, me in my
slick American uniform--figuring it might help improve relations between the two
countries, which were touchy at the time with the occupation still on.
But somebody
squashed the idea...." So....

 Oh, I didnt know that.
Oh, what a pity.
He didnt tell me.
But that wouldve
been great, a great experience for me.
He was a really, really unfortunate person, died
very young.
659
 Yeah, yeah.
Okay, so I wanted to make sure we covered that, since he did talk
about you.
I think this is one of the few accounts of somebody actually seeing you
performing in Japan.
So, now youre in America (laughs), youre in Boston, of all
places!

 Yeah, Im in Boston, right.
663
 Now youre taking lessons.
So talk about what it was like being in that school,
and taking lessons, and who the teachers were, et cetera.

 Well, first, as I said before, I landed at two oclock in the morning, Sunday
morning.
And uh, three men, the first time I met: it was George Wein, uh, the founder,
Lawrence Berk, then George Wein Newport festivals public relations person, called
Harry Paul.
Those three people came to greet me at the airport.
Then, I learned that
evening was the Bud Powell Trios last day at Storyville, and I said, "Boy, thats
something!
"
667
 (Laughs)

 The day I landed, that was his last day.
And Ed Thigpen was the
drummer, who was drafted and was in the Korean War and he had a relief and came to
Tokyo and sat in.
See, the jazz world is very small, and so anybody who was drafted in
Tokyo, whatever it is, in Japan, theyd say, "If you go to Tokyo, if you seek for her
group, you can sit in and play.
" So thats the way itd always been.
So most of the
people who came they always kind of let me know they were there, and Ed Thigpen was one of
those and he sat in and played.
So, I knew he was with Bud, and he was there with Bud
Powell, and I really thought that was something.
And, as far as the school is concerned,
uh ... my problem was that I really didnt speak the language that well.
But, the good
thing about music is that, its not like studying English literature, so.... (laughs) That was
.. but most of the time ... the one that I started from first, at the very beginning, which I


know just about anything that they had to tell me.
The only things that I didnt know was
the Schi-- ... also they used to teach the Schillinger System.
They dont do that today,
but thats something that I didnt know, so.... To some degree that was very helpful to
me and it was ... it kind of accumulated my knowledge a little bit about certain
relationships between music and mathematics and what have you.
So on, so on.
671
 So you already felt comfortable with music theory?
Youd already ... basically
taught yourself music theory?

 Yes.
So ... but, what they ... if you know about music history--Im sure you
do--but, the point is, the theory comes after the composition, always.
So modern theory
and traditional theory is different.
Music was so ... theory is, put a very simple way, is
analyzing what happened in music, and make a theory out of it, which is not exactly, you
know, exactly, in my mind.
So it doesnt matter.
If you are a musically oriented person,
you learn by yourself and it still ends up musically.
And if you studied, youre not a
musical person, no matter how much you studied, you will not be able to create music.
Music is something like ... painting is the same thing.
Its good to have the knowledge,
but you dont have to have it.
Thats what I think.
675
 Okay.
Before we continue with the school, I want to go back and talk about you
seeing Bud Powell...,

 Yes.
679
 ... because I wanna know what ... did you meet him?
Did you talk to him?

 No, I was ... yeah, you know, because I knew Ed Thigpen.
So Ed Thigpen, at the intermission
time, Ed Thigpen came to me and said, "Why dont you sit in?
" you know.
And at this time--it
was a propeller (plane), so, I dont know, maybe three days or whatever it is, left for
departure--I hadnt played piano for probably like four days or something.
And uh, I sat
in, I think I probably played "I Remember April" or something like that--thats what I
think--but Im sure I didnt really play that well, because as I said, you know, I hadnt
played the piano.
But I heard Bud Powell laughing his head off behind me, and I finished
and I ... he took all, a deep bow.
He took a deep bow.
And ... this I have to mention:
later on--and there was something about Bud Powell, I had some degree of, uh,
something--because when I played in Philadelphia, in a place called Showboat, with a
trio, he would play at the Band Box.
In those days there were quite a lot of jazz clubs in
Philadelphia, and they were walking distance (from each other).
He used to come down
and listen to me.
And hed forget to go back to his job.
And he had a bodyguard,
because he was, you know, he had a problem and so on.
And, before that, it was even,
uh, the Hickory House, sometimes hed play at Birdland, and he would come to listen to
me.
And uh, same thing, you know, hed forget to go back, but....
The reason he was


listening to me was not the same reason I would listen to him or any other people.
Those
days, I would listen so I could learn something.
His case was ... he heard somebody
playing, obviously had (his) influence--and especially in those days, I played like Bud
Powell--and "Here (is someone who) obviously got a lot of influence from me, and its
somewhere that I havent been.
" Now, today a jazz musician goes to Japan maybe every
few months or what have you.
But the first jazz group (that) went--outside of Jazz at the
Philharmonic--was in 1961, Art Blakey, in January.
This was the first one.
After that,
you know, there were many groups.
But, so--Im talking about 56, 57, 58--no one
had) been in Japan and naturally he hadnt, and obviously he felt comfort, I think,
because he had a very difficult life.
Um, I read a book written by a Frenchman, and all
these things led me to believe he had a very difficult time.
And uh, it would comfort him,
I think, you know.
So he used to come listen to ... one time, he came to Hickory House,
he came and I asked him to sit in and he (??
), then he went upstairs--there was an
upstairs inside the bar--he played a little bit.
That was nice.
But its always something
.. then of course later on, he moved to Paris in 1958, and I got my first job at the Blue
Note in Paris in 1964.
Uh, April, "April in Paris"--it was nothing like that, though.
Cold
laughs).
Anyway, he had tuberculosis and he was in a sanitarium under the care of
Francis, Francis Paudras.
He would come, Sunday he would go to Francis loft and
Francis would take him back on Monday, or something like that.
But he ...
I think he
really wanted to go home, and finally he went back to the States.
But, because Francis
knew that I was kind of a disciple of Bud Powell, he had my recording, the one ... uh ... the
Storyville recording (The Toshiko Trio, 1956), with some of my compositions.
One is
called "Studio J" (on The Many Sides of Toshiko, 1957).
Thats the room where we used
to learn, you know, tunes, Studio J.
And Bud Powell listened to that and he said, "Did you write
that?
" and I said, "Yes," and he said, "Youre the best female piano player.
" He said that
to me, and that would carry me for a long time; when I had a hard time, almost quit, Id
say, "Well, Bud Powell said that, so I must have something," or something.
But, because
of that, I wanted to form the big band, because Lew Tabackin wanted to do something, you know,
not (that) I wanted to have a big band, so my job was to write the music, and thats why I
have "Studio J" orchestrated.
Many bands like that.
They especially like the shout
chorus.
So I have quite fond memories of Bud Powell.
I feel like its really karma, the fact that
he always seemed to be playing when I was playing there.
And it was ... the first time I
heard him in person, it wasnt like, uh, you know, his prime time, but it was amazing that
.. to ... not ... like almost like automatically moving, you know.
Im sure he practiced a
lot, you know, when he was in his young days, otherwise it wouldnt be like that.
And I
heard, uh, some tapes made in Paris, and it was this incredibly fast Bach tune (sings), so
he had things in the head and, uh, every once in a while that came out.
What I
understand, altogether four times he had electric shock treatment, which is not exactly
kosher, I dont think.
He had a really difficult time, I think.
683
 Well, were gonna return to your experience at Berklee, but Im looking at the
discography, and its listing as your second recording The Toshiko Trio, and its Paul


Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

 Yeah.
687
 ... and this says its Storyville, Boston, recorded in Boston, 1954.
Is that
correct?

 No, New York.
691
 New York.
But it was in the States in 1954?

 Ye--19, no, not 54....
695
 Should be later.

 56, I think.
699
 Should be 56.
So, we should get in touch with Tom Lord and let him know.
Okay.

 56, I dont know, George Wein was at that time music director, A&R man for
Storyville recordings.
So, we did two recordings in New York.
One was (with) Paul
Chambers--Miles Davis had some kind of problem with his throat, and they werent working--
so Paul Chambers and Ed Thigpen.
Another one was with Roy Haynes and Oscar Pettiford.
Ooh,
that was really something.
Yes.
703
 (Chuckles) Yeah.
Well, the discography continues with several other recordings
in Japan....

 Yes.
707
 ... but well come back to that, maybe tomorrow.
But I want to continue on,
since were already at Berklee, so to go ahead and talk more about ... you said that you
got there, youre taking lessons, you already were familiar with a lot of the....

 Yes, already I knew, but one thing about the--I think the Japanese, they dont
say anything, I mean, I didnt--that year, there was a Jazz at the Philharmonic that came
to the Symphony Hall, and Norman Granzz told Oscar, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_176">Oscar Peterson</span> came to see me,
and he said, "You should be playing, not (be) in a school," you know.
And uh ... and he
was very nice to me, and I probably wouldve liked to do that.
But I came with a full
scholarship and I didnt have enough heart to do that.
So, I guess it was a ... sometimes I
wonder if I wouldve liked ... most of the students came, especially from Europe,


someone like Joe Zawinul, somebody like that came to Berklee, then you know, got out
very quick, very fast and so on, so on.
But.
I dont think he came with a scholarship.
In
my case, you know, I felt like I had an obligation.
So that was ... and sometimes I
wonder about if Id got out and if I were playing, I wonder if Id have been a more, you
know, noted pianist, whom everybody would look for, as some kinds of pianists were.
But at the same time, I think probably I wouldnt be writing, or whatever it is, you know.
I think everything worked out the way it was supposed to work out.
So that was, so I
wasnt ... but I really wanted to get out.
My reason for getting out was to get the diploma
from, I mean, to get the Schillinger test passed, so thats what I did three years later, and I
got out of the school in three and half years, so....
But most of the time I was, like ... for
example, summertime, uh, there were six weeks, and sometimes I was at the Hickory
House, and the first year, I was playing with a trio, which was, at that time at the school
there was Jake Hanna--a great drummer who lives in Los Angeles--and uh, Gene
Cherico, who was a wonderful, wonderful bass player, who died quite some time ago.
But, uh ... trio, we used to travel and go to different places.
And it was 57, 58 we were
at the Hickory House for four, you know, six weeks or so.
So mostly I was playing, (??
)
hours or more (a week) of playing, playing different places, so on.
711
 So this recording, The Toshiko Trio, that was George Wein?
That was George
Weins session?

 Yes, George Wein session.
715
 And ... do you remember much about that session?
You had, you know, Paul
Chambers and Ed Thigpen....

 No, the material, was all ...
I chose.
What I remember about it was, I had
written a thing called, uh, "Lazy Day.
" It was a lazy day, Sunday afternoon, so it was
Lazy Day.
" It has, like, a little bridge, it has a little, the bass had to play certain things,
you know.
And Paul Chambers went duduladah, and he said, "Lemme try to figure out
the fingering," and went bru-bru-bru the second time, and I said "Wha--!
" you know.
719
 (Laughs)

 "Wow, hes really, really good.
" Thats what I remember.
My only regret is
at that time, Norman Granzz actually offered to record a duet with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_188">Ray Brown</span>, that hed
rather I came (t)here.
But in order to do that I had to fly to Los Angeles, and the school
rejected that, so I couldnt do that.
That was ... there are two things that I really regret,
because the school didnt give me the permission to do.
This is one.
Another one was
Oscar Pettiford, when we recorded that year, you know ... Oscar had, before I left Japan,
Oscar had two recordings of kind of large ensembles, which was kind of unusual: two
French horns, and he was playing the cello, and so on.
And uh ... theres some harp, and


it was kind of interesting music (reissued on the CD Deep Passion).
He had a two-week
engagement at Birdland, and he offered me a job to be the piano player.
And then, the
school rejected that.
The reason was, if I were to play in New York I had to be the first, I
had to be the leader, or something like that.
I didnt want to be a leader and somehow I
was pushed into (being) a leader.
I wasnt ...
I like, I would be the happiest person if I
were a great sideman, side player.
723
 (Chuckles)

 And uh ... that was ... but, I guess everything worked out the way it worked
out.
I learned a lot of things about being a leader.
So, thats okay.
727
 There are some very interesting titles on this LP.
You have "Soshu no yora,"
and....

 "Sosh no yoru.
"
731
 They mustve misspelled it.

 "Sosh no yoru" is a Japanese pop tune (composed by Saij Saijo Saijo Yaso and Niki
Kitao).
Pop music.
"Sosh" is the name of a place in China (Szhu).
Yoru is
evening," as you know.
"Evening of Sosh," thats how its supposed to be.
735
 (Chuckles) Okay.
And then you have "Kysh"?

 Hmm?
739
 Another one called "Kysh"?

 "Kysh.
" Kysh is like a nostalgic, you know, nostalgic ... uh, for where
you came from, youre kind of a little homesick.
Little bit homesick, its kind of like
that.
743
 And then "Homework.
" I dont know, was that a...?

 Huh?
747
 Called "Homework" (chuckles), "Homework.
"

 "Homework"?
751
 Yes, so (chuckles) maybe somebody else took liberties with the titles.
Or maybe


somebody needs to redo this (discography) (laughs).

 No, that "Groove for Toshiko" is not the same thing, as that one.
755
 Oh, the other one.
See this is actually, this is the real title....

 This actually, uh....
759
 I think what Im trying to highlight here is that youre composing, so, several
compositions, but well talk about that later in the interview, your process of
composition, et cetera.
But the fact that, you know, you have several originals on this
session, so....

 Yeah, right.
I think its, I started writing because, when I came to <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_1314_929215">Boston</span> I
used to, of course, I used to go every night to listen, and in those days like, uh, even the
big bands, like Dukes band or Count Basie band, would stay for two weeks, you know, at a
club.
You cant think of that today, but....
I was always sitting in, I decided that when I,
if somebody asked me to sit in, I was going to sit in.
You know, I decided that.
So, I
used to sit in with, Max (Roach) would let me sit in, Miles Davis would let me sit in, so on, so
on.
So ... but Diz had a big band in those days, and Phil Woods was, I think, lead alto,
and uh, Melba Liston was playing trombone.
Anyway, uh, I was sitting in, playing, and I
heard, "Bud Powell!
Bud Powell!
" When I played people said, "Aw, shes Bud Powell!
Shes
Bud Powell!
" And I started thinking, I said, "I guess thats no good, I have to, you know,
to try to find my own idiosyncrasy.
" One of the (reasons) I started writing, one of the
things that, I think, thats the reason I started writing, to develop my own idiosyncrasy.
So writing was something I was never interested in before.
763
 Was your experience at Berklee, did it, um, uh ... highlight or advance this
compositional impetus of yours?
Did it help you in any way, or...?

 I think it helped me to reorganize my thoughts.
But, I used to have ... you see,
before that, I came to this country, in Japan I had a nonet for the broadcast only.
For the
.. NHK had a jazz program....
767
 We didnt talk about that.
Maybe we should....

 Yeah, so ...
I had a nonet.
Those days I was influenced by, like, having a
good French horn player, you know, things like that.
And uh ... there werent any
Japanese French horn players that I knew of, so I had an American, uh, French horn
player who had been drafted.
We used to record at midnight for three programs, taping,
so on, so on, and I was, used to write.
Also, it was trial-and-error writing, you know, I
never learned to write.
But some of them worked out okay, and so on.
And uh, so I was


writing before I came to this country.
So, when I had this orchestration class with Herb
Pomeroy, and he said, "Well, youre not supposed to do this yet!
" you know, he said
things like that.
771
 (Laughs)

 (Laughs) So, uh ... it helped me to reorganize what I did.
I did ... in other
words, if I were to teach, that wouldve helped.
You know, I have no interest, but if I
were to teach, that was organizing your, in other words, organizing, systemize, and that
would help (me) teach.
But, as I said before, music, its not necessary to have all that, uh,
all that knowledge and all that.
Its good to have knowledge, I think, but, it doesnt have
to.
775
 Who were some of the other students that you were in classes with?
You
mentioned several profe--, uh, teachers....

 Yes.
Gene Cherico.
He was, he had a natural ear.
He used to be a drummer.
And when he was in the service he got in a car accident that hit a train, and he almost lost
his life.
So anyway, he, the arm, the surgeon took a bone from (his) hip and replaced the
arm, and he suggested he play the bass, pull the bass, to help (recover).
Thats how he
became a bass player.
So, Im not saying because of that, but he had a natural beat, he
was really a ... you know, but he had a tremendous ear.
He didnt know much about
theory.
And uh, sometimes Id ask, "How do these changes go?
" and hed say, "Well, I
dont know, I play a B-flat and I..." (laughs).
And Jake Hanna always had a beautiful sound; he
knew how to tune the drums, he was just fantastic that way.
I mean, he still probably is.
And uh ... so we had a very good time, you know, playing together.
And that was a good
.. there was a young player, at that time he was eighteen years (old) or something.
Im
not quite sure, there were two of them, one was called Jimmy Mosher, alto player--I
think later on maybe he played in Woody Hermans band or something.
But anyone was,
when I was in school, there werent any ... (tiredly) uh, God ... the most students were
on the G.I.
Bill, so they were not exactly, you know, little children.
They were on the G.I
Bill and a lot of them already were professionals.
But there werent that many jazz
players; I think it was mostly players in the big bands or something like that.
Herb
Pomeroy had a big band at school.
Later on, he had a recording called Band in Boston,
two of them (the other being Life is a Many Splendored Gig).
It was a very good band.
Great writing came from Jaki Byard--boy, he could write!
And uh, it was a very
exciting band, so I used to listen, every Monday night they played and I used to listen to
that.
But all the other times I went to Storyville (laughs).
And learning the tunes, it was
Studio J and that was on the first floor, a large room, and we had to learn tunes, (chord)
changes, and things like that.
You know.
779
 Was there a piano teacher there or...?


 Pardon?
783
 Piano teacher?
Was there a piano teacher?

 Oh, yes!
When I went to school, Mister <span class="fullMatch" id="match_205">Lawrence Berk</span> arranged for me to
have piano lessons with <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1383_92">Madame</span> (Margaret Chaloff Chaloff) Chaloff</span>, who was the mother of <span class="fullMatch" id="match_206">Serge
Chaloff.
And she was the student of a famous piano teacher, Madame Van Guelph
sp??).
And she was teaching at Boston University, so I had to go there to have a lesson.
But, she was wonderful because she taught me, more than anything, she taught me how to
practice.
That was (??).
But the school really wanted me to become like a, you know,
virtuoso player, because I had to play--I remember, there was Cacciatore, I think, it was
concerto, I think it was--anyway, I was struggling trying to play it.
And I had to play for
Arthur Fiedler in daytime (chuckles).
Arthur Fiedler said, "You shouldnt be so like that,
you should be (coos), walk out a little bit, look at the sky," you know, blah, blah, blah,
things like that.
But uh ...
I really wanted to be at Birdland, first of all, you know.
I
wanted to play at Birdland, but the school wanted me to play at the Hickory House,
because that had more merit or something, for pianists.
Maybe they paid better, I dont
know (laughs).
But all those Birdland things, I could do that after I left school.
And at
that time (my) manager was Oscar Woodstein, he was the manager, Oscar Woodstein.
Later on, I learned from Francis book that he was Bud Powell manager, which I didnt
know that.
And Oscar Woodstein hired me quite often, (for) which (Im) really grateful.
And I have no way of knowing the reason, but I suspect--after I read Francis book, that
he was the manager (for Powell)--that ...
Bud Powell left the States in 1958, so I think maybe
I) reminded him of Bud Powell.
Maybe, maybe thats why he hired me all the time or
something.
In those days, two groups, you know, so I didnt have to be (the) drawing
power.
I was able to be in Count Basie band and my trio, or sometimes it was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_212">Miles Davis</span>
and my trio, things like that, so.... <span class="fullMatch" id="match_213">Pee Wee Marquette</span> was the announcer and uh, he
would mispronounce my name.
787
 How did he pronounce it?

 I ... Tokisho or something.
I didnt know he was doing that purposely.
You
were supposed to give him money.
I didnt know that.
Gene Cherico told me, so I said,
Okay," so, and after that everything was okay.
791
 (Laughs) Well, I wanted to ask you about, you know, you said that while you
were in Boston you got a chance to play with people because they were on extended
engagements.
You said you played with Miles and Max Roach.
What were those
experiences like?

 Miles Davis, he would let me sit in.
But when I went, he would lean on the piano


and hed watch me, my hands, like this, and I was like this (demonstrates nervousness),
you know.
And he said to me, "Are you nervous?
" I said, "Yes.
" He said, "Well, dont
be.
But I felt the same way with Bird.
" Thats what he told me.
Now, Miles Davis was not
exactly the way people think, hes an evil guy, so on, so on.
But hes not exactly like
that, you know.
He was a nice man; I think it depended on whom he was speaking to, he
probably, thats what it was.
But, as I said, if I sat in hed say, "Bud Powell!
Bud Powell!
" you
know (chuckles).
795
 (Laughing) Right.

 And Max Roach was ... he always played, firstly, always incredibly fast.
That
was his style.
So, first day, it was the second day?
The pianist disappeared or something.
So there was a pianist living in Boston, called Joey Master, he was noted, I guess, so he
was subbing.
But he (Max) always played fast, so (chuckles) Joey came up to me and
said, he said, "You want to sit in?
" so I said (??
laughing).
Firstly, Max Roach always played
fast.
And uh, the first time he had, uh ... Clifford (Brown) and, uh, Sonny Rollins....
799
 And Richie.

 Yes, Clifford (Richie) was ... uh, Buds brother.
803
 Yeah, Richie Powell, right.

 Yes.
And uh, anyway--I think it was George Morrow on bass....
807
 George Moro on bass, that was the, that was that quintet.

 But Clifford Brown was ... if you met him, I was so surprised, because if you
met him on the street, you would never guess he was a jazz player.
He looked like a--
and he was so sane (serious) too, he was very sane--he couldve been an insurance
company (salesman) (laughs).
I think he was, Max Roach was quite, quite ... attached to
Clifford Brown, because when he died by car crash, he really was, Max Roach was crushed, you know,
so.....
But that was the group.
Actually I had a photo in Birdland, I was sitting in--
somebody has it, anyway.
Max Roach never said to me, "Shes Bud Powell," but Im sure....
811
 Well, he had Richie!

 Huh?
815
 He had Richie, his brother, on piano!

 Richie Powell was ... what I understand is that Bud Powell taught Richie Powell.
<span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1428_113">Bud Powell</span> was


actually formally trained and uh....
819
 What did you think of Richies playing?
Did you hear him much?

 Yeah, he played ... you know, played well, just like everybody else.
Actually,
I liked, I liked ... the first time when I was here, <span class="fullMatch" id="match_233">Miles Davis</span> group was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_235">Paul Chambers</span> and
<span class="fullMatch" id="match_234">Red Garland</span>, uh, Philly Joe Jones Jones (Jones).
That was something.
I really thought it was ... that
was like a modern, what do you call, Count Basie famous, you know, rhythm section, except
no guitar player.
But uh, it was really fantastic.
823
 Was Coltrane in the group, too?

 First John Coltrane, then it was a short while, he was replaced by Sonny Rollins.
He was there briefly, then John Coltrane (came) back.
But before John Coltrane, after he (got) back
he would sit in a lot, and thats what the people know (as) John Coltrane today.
But the first
John Coltrane, when I heard, he was a little more like Sonny Stitt, kind of like that.
Except he
had his own little voice, you know; I mean his tone was a little bit different.
But he was
kind of a Sonny Stitt-type of player.
827
 And you also had a chance to play with Roy Haynes, or sit in with Roy Haynes?

 Oh, Roy Haynes didnt have a group.
831
 Yeah, thats what I suspect, so....

 He was working with Sarah Vaughan.
He was playing, backing for Sarah
Vaughan those days, so....
But he was voted (one of the) ten best-dressed men by
Esquire!
835
 (Laughs) Esquire.

 Oh, you know about that?
(laughs)
839
 He and Miles, both.

 He was a sharp dresser.
843
 Still is!
(chuckles) Okay, well, I think probably this is a good time to stop....

 Very good.
847
 ... and we can move on after your Berklee experience.
But we want to pick up


with talking about Hickory House, how you got those engagements, and now you start
your real career (laughs).

 (Modestly) Well, I dont know....
851
 In America, at least.

 Yeah.
855
 Today is June 30th, 2008, and this is day two of the Smithsonian Jazz Oral
History interview with composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader Toshiko Akiyoshi, at her
home in Manhattan, New York.
Konnichi wa, Toshiko-san.

 Konnichi wa.
859
 So when I was making the introduction, you kind of made a grimace.
Did I not,
did I leave something out?
Composer, pianist, arranger, bandleader....

 No, I think you said too much (laughs).
863
 Too much (laughs).
But, um, these are your accomplishments; theyre very well
recorded, so we have to at least honor ... some of them, at least, so....

 Thank you.
867
 When we left off yesterday, we were talking about, you had just finished your
tenure at Berklee School, and you were now going to launch your professional career.
But, you know, you did talk about that you were already performing in Boston and also in
New York ... you played at Storyville?

 Uh, Storyville, I started to play Storyville in 56, March, from Thursday to
Sunday.
And uh, in those days, most clubs had two groups.
So the main group from ...
both in a seven nights term, plus a matinee.
So, but shorter hours than in New York:
New York, those days, was 10 to 4, and Boston was 9 to 1, and seven nights, plus the
matinee Sunday afternoon.
So, um, I started to play, but the main group was from
Tuesday to Sunday.
And uh, that was very good for me, because I could hear also ... um,
the school thought--I think <span class="fullMatch" id="match_252">George Wein</span>, actually, thought--that I should have a horn
player, so there was <span class="fullMatch" id="match_253">Boots Mussulli</span>, who used to be an old timer with Stan Kenton
band.
871
 Whats his name again?


 Boots Mussulli.
875
 Mussulli.

 Boo--Boots Mussulli.
He was retired and he was from Milford,
Massachusetts.
And he was ...
I heard with a small group, recording, you know.
He had
impeccable technique, but for an Italian, he was very cold, kind of a very intellectual
player.
It was kind of like totally opposite of somebody like Charlie Mariano, who was
much more hot-blooded a player.
Boots Mussulli was much more, kind of, intellectual, cool
player, and it was very good for me that he was there.
I used to ... you know, I used to,
when I played, I thought I did something wrong--in my mind--made a mistake, I used to
put my tongue out, you know, like, "Aww!
" like that (laughs), so Boots Mussulli said, you know,
Don't do that.
Your mistakes are good: youre trying to build something from what you
thought you made (was) a mistake.
" He was very good for me, advice and so on.
It was
good.
879
 And so the Storyville, was that something that was arranged through Berklee?
Did they arrange...?

 Yes, yes, so....
883
 And then you also said that you went to New York to play at the Hickory House.
How did...?

 That was 57.
887
 Okay, so this was later.

 So, well, I mean, that ... the school asked the booking agent in New York
called Joe Glaser--the biggest one (client) was, I think, Armstrong.
Anyway, Joe
Glasers office handled my affairs and theyre the ones (who) booked my trio at <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_1515_1071191">Hickory
House</span>.
I said this yesterday, but I really wanted to go to a place like Birdland, you know.
891
 Right.

 But the school thought it was a better place, it was supposed to be a higher
profile for a pianist.
But, I had a lot of problems at the Hickory House; it was six weeks,
two years in a row, 57 and 58.
But they were always, "Play show tunes!
Play show
tunes!
" Because most of ... thats a steak house, if you remember.
And um, the stage
was in the middle part; there was a circle bar, and the stage was on the inside of the bar,
so the people look at (you) like.... And usually, most of the people came to eat, have
some dinner before a Broadway show or whatever.
After Broadway show theyd come


back, either they would have dinner or a drink or whatever it is.
Thats what, I guess, the
theme was.
Most of those places you had to play a lot of show tunes, and I didnt know
too many show tunes, and wed play Buds tunes or Monks tunes, things like that, you
know, they always really ... "Play show tunes!
Play show tunes!
" And I ...
I, up til
today I think I was booked in the wrong place.
But ...
I dont blame them.
I think
theres a place--I didnt know then, I do now--but theres a place for that kind of ...
somewhere between a cocktail lounge and a jazz club, uh, different from a Five Spot or a
Half Note or a Birdland, and that goes in a different category.
I know now, but I didnt
know then, so I was playing things that they probably didnt want to hear (laughs).
895
 (Laughs) Did you ever get to play Birdland during this period?

 Oh, after I got out of school...,
899
 Ah, okay.

 ...and I think I mentioned yesterday, the fact is I was very lucky, that was
Oscar Woodstein, who was my manager at that time.
He hired me quite often.
So that
was really ... and, you know, I was saying before there were always two groups, and uh,
even though I was there.... See, New York was a six-night town, and no matinee, but
long hours.
But, always the main group was there--I wasnt, I didnt feel that
responsibility for drawing people.
But he always, often hired me.
Im grateful today.
903
 Do you remember some of the groups that you were on the bill with?
The other
groups?

 Oh yes.
Sometimes it was Miles Davis group--only it was, John Coltrane was there
after Sonny Rollins.
That ... the old Birdlands band room, backstage, it was like what
we call ... Japanese have a saying, "a bed for an eel.
" In other words, long and narrow.
And thats where the backstage was.
But when it was Miles Davis group, they all played very
long solos, except Miles Davis didnt play long solos.
But ... hed (John Coltrane) play a long solo,
then it was ... John Coltrane would get off the stage and go backstage and try and woodshed.
And so you couldnt really use the room (laughs)!
That was a funny way ... and also,
Birdland was a very interesting place: that was the only place then, backstage there was a
little bar for musicians.
Set up for musicians.
And those days I wasnt drinking, so I
dont know how much it cost; I think it was maybe half-price or whatever it was.
And
uh, and those days it was the only club that took intermission ... excuse me, charged
admission, was Birdland.
That was the only place.
Every place, uh, some places mayve
had cover charges on the weekends, but they didnt have anything (on weekdays).
But
Birdland, you go step down, dun-dun-dun, then there was a little window just like a
movie theater.
I think it was $1.30, Im not quite sure, though.
Somewhere around there.
Then you go in there, there were three different sections.
Youre looking at the stage and


on the extreme right is the bar.
Thats where you ...
I think a drink was somewhere like
cents, it wasnt quite a dollar, I think, you know.
Then the next section was just chairs
only, where you didnt have to drink, you just--everybody had to pay admission--but if
you sit there, you could sit all night, not spending any more money.
Then, the third one,
which was the main part, where they had the tables.
They had a cover charge--I believe
it was $5, Im not quite sure.
I think it was $5--and thats where people could sit at a
table, but then you had to pay a cover charge.
But it was the three ... it was very good,
the fact is, if somebody was really into a certain group and they wanted to hear without
paying too much, there was a place where you could just sit, you didnt have to order any
drinks.
So that was a kind of unique place, I think, you know, for a long, long time.
907
 How was the piano at Birdland?

 The Birdland piano was not that great.
It was never gre ...
I dont think they
pianos) were their own, I think customarily they used to rent the piano from a piano
place, and periodically theyd change.
I remember much later, I was hired at Top of the
Gate as a soloist, in between other groups.
And uh, it wasnt a Steinway, but one time
they had a Steinway that was a ... this piano really liked me!
And we got along really
well, and if Id had the money I wouldve bought it.
But, it seems to be customary, they
kind of change, except the Half Note always had the same piano, I think.
But the places,
the Top of the Gate, they usually changed the piano.
Probably same thing at Birdland,
Im not quite sure.
But they had, at least they had a grand piano.
If you went outside
New York), like Philadelphia, I usually played--first time was the Blue Note, then after
that it was a place called Showboat--but they were all upright.
They didnt have grand
pianos.
And most of the keys were ... most of the places, it was upright piano.
Some
places ... there was a place called, uh ...
I think it was called the Dew Drop Inn, Im not
quite sure, I think it was called Dew Drop Inn, in New Jersey.
It was basically an organ
room.
But Sunday afternoons they had a jam (session), jazz.
And I was hired several
times but they always had a guest player--one time it was Jimmy Heath, another time it
was, I think, Diz--but this piano, a few strings were missing (laughs).
Things like that.
I
guess, some things have progressed today: at least you dont have pianos like that today!
(laughs)
911
 (Laughs) You talked about a double bill with Miles Davis.
What was your
impression of John Coltrane?
Did you ... get to know him ... very well?

 (Coughs) Well, the first time I heard of John Coltrane was in Los Angeles.
And uh,
with Miles Davis group with ... that was the first time I heard, uh....
915
 Paul Chambers?

 Paul Chambers.
And I think hed just joined, 56 January, because Id heard


probably heard every record when I was in Japan, and most of the players I knew.
But
Id never heard of Paul Chambers.
And uh ... boy, I caught the last set and he played,
took a solo, and I was "Boy!
" He sounded so good, I said "Ahh," and I didnt even know
the person, I thought, "My God!
What a country!
" you know.
People who had no names
played that great!
That wasnt the case, I found later on, but something like that.
And
John Coltrane ...
I think I mayve said this before, he sounded more like, a little close to
Sonny Stitt, then um.... One short period, Miles Davis had Sonny Rollins, and after Sonny
Rollins he came back, John Coltrane came back.
After that, it was a different John Coltrane.
He was woodshedding almost all the time, he was just practicing all the time.
And thats
what everybody knows, you know, John Coltrane today, I think.
919
 So, uh, going back to the trajectory of your career: so, youre starting to get a
name, youre playing the major clubs.
Are you starting to tour at this point?
Oh, maybe I
misrepresented this.... (laughs)

 No, actually, you know, after I got out of school and I moved to New York,
my very, original intention was, after I finished school, I should go back to Japan and I
was supposed to, uh, I thought I should, uh ... give to fellow musicians, you know, to
pass on something that I have learned.
But when I finished school, I didnt realize, and it
was just, "Boy, what did I do?
What did I accomplish?
What did I learn?
" I realized
that I hadnt learned anything.
I said, "Well, gee, I dont think I can go home now," so I
moved to New York.
And after I moved to New York, I was just like everybody else,
you know, just barely paying the rent.
Its kind of interesting, because Im basically kind
of shy--I think it comes up from my upbringing--so I had somebody come in from the
other side, and I knew who they are, who he is, or most of the men, the players.
Id say,
Oh, I dont think he knows me, and if he says hi, I think I might say hi.
" You know,
something like that, never....
So when I moved to New York, I decided that I was going
to push myself to say "hello," you know.
So theres Birdland ... and when I moved I was
staying in a hotel called Hotel Bryant.
923
 Bryant.
Where was...?

 It was 54th and off Broadway.
And uh, there was a ... 52nd and Broadway, as
you know, was Birdland.
But, it wasnt the corner, there was Birdland.
There on the
corner was a coffee shop and one day I went there to have some breakfast--in my case, a
late breakfast--and I saw Slide Hampton sitting in there.
My first reaction was, "Oh, Im
going to go home," but then I decided, "I think Ill go up," and I said, "Hello.
" He said,
Oh yes, please sit down.
" Then he said--this was kind of interesting--he said, "You
know, I used to think you were stuck up!
But I know you are shy.
" So I realized that
people do think that way, and I had to go up and say "hello.
" And also at the same time,
in later years, even today, some people, I think ... you know, like a little ... they think
they take themselves seriously.
And uh, then think about what Slide Hampton said, and say,


Maybe theyre shy," so I give them the benefit of the doubt.
So that was good that he
said that.
927
 Youre starting to become a New Yorker now (chuckles).

 Mm, I dont know; I was just like any other New York jazz musician who
didnt have much name and was struggling.
You know, I was, I became a part of it.
931
 So, um, so this is into the late fifties now.
So in 1959, kind of a lot of changes
happen in your life.

 Uh, it did?
935
 Uh, well, you married Charlie Mariano.

 Oh yes.
939
 (Chuckles)

 Yes and uh, right.
And that ... we moved to New Jersey.
And we formed a
quartet.
Before that, I was always with a trio, so we had a quartet.
But it was the same
time.... And, my job was not only that I had to call Joe Glaser office every once in a
while, to say, "Do you have anything for us?
" Cause as it was, theyd forget, so it was
something periodically, I had to do to do that.
That was ...
I wasnt quite comfortable
with that, but it was, that was necessary.
And sometimes theyd say, "Oh yes, we have
some place in Pittsburgh," or things like that.
But its amazing, actually, (that we)
survived.
Always, something came up, so that we could pay the rent.
943
 How did you meet Charlie?

 School.
He was ... when I was still in school, he was in Shellys group, Shelly
Mannes group in Los Angeles.
But he was originally from Boston.
And uh, he decided
to come home.
So when he came back to Boston, he started teaching school.
Thats how
I met him, you know.
947
 And it ... you had a quintet as well as a quartet with Charlie?

 No, quartet.
951
 Just only a quartet?

 Just a quartet.

955
 Okay, so that needs to be corrected ... the Grove lists a quintet, as well.
And
you had personnel, was Gene and Jake first, or no?

 No, the time when we had a quartet together, Jake Hanna was already, hed left
school--I think he was playing with Woodys band--it could be, I think it was Woody
Hermans band.
It could be Maynard Fergusons (Ferguson), Im not quite sure about that part.
But, so, Gene Cherico, always he had a knack for finding a drummer.
We had a job in
Hartford, a place called High Brein (sp??
) Lounge--or Few Brein (sp??
), I dont know
how to pronounce it--it was a beer company or whatever.
Anyway, we were looking for
a drummer, Gene Cherico said, "Oh, theres a drummer, Eddie Marshall," you know, "he is really
good!
" And he was about twenty-, maybe, two years old or something.
"We should try
him!
" So we went to High Brein Lounge and he came--hes from Springfield,
Massachusetts--so he came and sat in and played.
I really liked it, of course, and Gene Cherico
.. usually bass players and drummers, if theyre getting on well, thats a good rhythm
section so.... And Eddie Marshall was so nervous (chuckles), he spilled water onto Marianos lap.
He still is a very good friend of mine and also I, you know, often play with him, and uh
.. theres something about when youre young, when you play together for a while, its
always something special.
So after that, it was Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico, thats the group we went
to our first Japanese trip, to Japan, the concert trip to Japan was 61.
That was the first
one, after five years in this country, it was the first time I was back in Japan.
And it was
Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico.
And it was the same thing the second time, I think.
So, he, then he was
drafted, Eddie Marshall was drafted into the Army, and for a while he was away.
And he came
back and we ... at that time, and then we played together, we played (as) a trio quite
often.
And of course, Gene Cherico went to Frank Sinatra....
959
 (Laughs)

 (Laughs) And Eddie Marshall and Gene Cherico both were at one time with Stan Getz, and one
day I got a call from them, somewhere, and they said, "Toshiko, you got your rhythm
section back.
"
963
 (Laughs)

 They decided to quit (laughs).
967
 Well, I know Eddie, of course, being in San Francisco.
Hes a great friend and
also hes a great, great inspiration of mine.
I have my idea of what makes Eddie great;
what would you say were the hallmarks, or what was it about his style that you like?

 Well, first of all, I think its that he has a good beat, which is very important to
me.
Sometimes its ... this is something that is ... its not mathematically.... And also,


not every drummer is for every somebody.
In other words, if a drummers great for
somebody else, it doesnt mean great for me.
Theres a certain mystical, certain things
there, and it was something you can identify, you know, together.
Eddies great part was
that hes also very open minded: hes a very intelligent man, and uh, he also, hes the first
drummer that I know--I met, that is--who played soft with the sticks.
He really had a
beautiful touch, and he was, as I said, he was very open minded, he was very susceptible
to many different things.
He still is.
971
 Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

 So we are very good friends, I would like to say.
You know, he said, the other
day, he was saying--I dont know how he said it--he said, "Tooo-shiko, I am getting
old" (chuckles).
975
 (Laughs)

 I dont know why he said that!
979
 (Laughs) What was your impression going back to Japan, after having not been
back in four years?

 I was very, very worried about it, because five years I was away, and I didnt
know if people would remember me or not.
And also this time, we were going back with
our original music, most of my original music, which was not done in those days in
Japan.
People always played, you know, somebody elses music or standards, things like
that.
So I had to explain about the music: explain to the point where it was easy to
understand and, you know, some kind of guide for listening.
That was ... but when we
landed at Haneda--those days, Haneda airport--and the plane was about four hours late.
But there were people waiting and I was really surprised.
You know, there was, like,
cameras and journalists were there, and a lot of fans were waiting, and I was really
surprised about that.
So, in those days, the tour was a very long dis--, that time it was
six weeks long.
And in 1963, we went back again, with the same promoter, also six
weeks.
But now, if you have a tour, so usually they say, I dont know, if you have
fourteen concerts, thats pretty, pretty long.
983
 So six weeks, you mustve toured....

 Yes.
987
 ...outside of Tokyo as well?
What kind of...?

 Every (kind of) places that you can think of, I think.

991
 (Laughs) Okay.

 And those days also, I think it was, um, union--uh, Ron (abbreviation for
Kinrsha Ongaku Kygikai, Workers Music Council) they called (it)--labor unions had
music activities.
And those were the ones that had, like, sort of like a network for going
to places, and I think that was the main, you know, outlet, yeah.
995
 Because when you were talking about the scene in Japan, the jazz in scene in
Japan before you left, um, how that it was mostly centralized in (the) Tokyo area.
Now
were you able, did you go to ja-, was there a jazz scene in saka...?

 Different places, right.
999
 ...or Nara, or other places?
So you went all over Japan.

 Right, yes.
1003
 So that time, by (the) sixties, there were many different clubs in different cities,
jazz clubs.

 Yeah, not ... (they were) all concerts.
1007
 All concerts.

 I dont think we ever played a club in those days, you know, they were all
concerts.
In sixty, 61, uh ... Art Blakey went in January--his group, (Jazz)
Messengers--and we went there in March.
So, but after that, Art Blakey, every year, he
would go to Japan, and that was the beginning of the American players going, (to) start
going to Japan.
1011
 Mm-hmm.

 He was really popular in Japan.
1015
 Did you consider your tour successful?
Did your, the audience enjoy your
music?

 Apparently it was successful, otherwise we would not have gone back in 63.
Excuse me.
(Goes to see about periodic beeping sound)
1019
 Is that a smoke alarm?


 (Track starts in middle of sentence) ...same, six, uh, six weeks.
And that time
I stayed, because (in) 63 I was pregnant with my first child, and I was a little worried
about having a child in this country.
I wanted to be near my mother.
So after that I just
stayed, and I was due in August, so I just stayed there and had my child, which is ... now
she has her own family and own group.
1023
 Could you say her name?

 Monday Michiru.
1027
 Say it again, please?

 Monday Michiru, you know, like Tuesday, Monday Michiru, Tuesday...?
1031
 (Chuckles) Okay.

 Thats because she was born on a Monday Michiru, so I named her Monday Michiru.
Monday Monday Michiru
is a Japanese ... Michiru is like uh, you know, tide it comes, high tide?
Thats ... its like
.. we call it michiru.
Monday Monday Michiru means something thats little and it gets fuller, so I was
hoping that she would get mature as a human being as she got older, so on, you know,
thats what....
1035
 And what was her birth date?

 August 19th.
1039
 August 19th, 1963?

 Yes.
1043
 Uh-huh, okay.

 Im not quite sure she appreciates that (laughs)..., saying that, though!
1047
 Well, her mother gave her her birthday, so she can give her birthday, too.

 No, but she is a singer and a writer, and its different than, you know I always
say its different from a musician, because they ... also, they have a different union, you
know (laughs).
1051
 Different union?
(laughs)



 That proves (it)!
1055
 Its all economics.
So, um, lets go back: so in 62 you went to Japan, in 63 you
went to Japan, but in 62 also, something significant happened in your life.

 Sixty-what?
1059
 62?
1962?

 Two?
1063
 So you went to Japan in 61-62...?

 61 and 63.
1067
 63?
So, 62 something ... this is when you played with Charles Mingus?

 No, no.
1071
 No?

 Playing with Charles Mingus was after I was separated from, uh....
1075
 Charlie?

 ...Charlie Mariano.
So, its much later.
I, I....
It has to be after 64....
1079
 Has to be after 64?

 ...because in 64 Japan had the Olympics....
1083
 Right.
I was there, too (chuckles).

 So, no, I was there, uh....
1087
 Duke Ellington came, too.

 Oh, yes, yes.
1091
 Yeah, I remember.


 So it has to be after that.
1095
 Mm-hmm.

 So the Charles Mingus....
When Charles Mingus asked me to join, I was really alone and
struggling.
Barely paying the rent.
And uh, my daughter was with my sister in Japan,
and--I think shed just started kindergarten or something, kindergarten or grammar
school, Im not quite sure.
1099
 So she was born in 63, so lets go back....

 Yes.
1103
 So, for the record, make sure that, in Grove Dictionary they have it listed as 62,
that is incorrect.

 Okay, now, she was born in 63, so it has to be, with Charles Mingus, it has to be after

Thats what I think.
1107
 Okay, okay.
So ... so lets go back.
In 63, you give birth to your daughter, so
you stay in Japan?

 Yes.
1111
 For how long?

 From there, in 64, uh, Charlie Mariano and I went to Europe for ... we had a club
engagement in Paris for four weeks, and then two weeks in each, one in Copenhagen, and
another one in Sweden, at the Golden Circle, I think it was.
In Denmark was, you know,
more (of a) market.
Then we went back to Japan again, so that ... uh, 63, and 64, thats
when the Olympics.... And I had a little project.
We had a concert, the project with....
And we were trying to get, saying this is.... Um, you know, people have....
In those
days, I thought--I still feel the same way, but--people have very poor ears.
In other
words, since printing was invented, eyesight, everything, all the information goes from
the eyes, but--I dont if thats the reason or not--but the ear has never developed.
So,
people have a difficult time understanding music, and I thought maybe I could do
something with movement.
So not dance--but it is dance--but you dont see the dancer.
It was a shadow.
So I had this project and I had a concert and it was, the screen was
behind us, and the dancer would dance behind the screen.
So thats what comes out as a
shadow, the movement.
And it would help ...
I thought that might help music for the
listener, and help them to kind of maybe understand the music.
They dont have to
understand, but appreciate, the music.
Thats what I thought, and this was something I


have done one time only.
But I think that was a pretty good idea.
But anyway, so I had
this Japanese traditional dance company, but "traditional" meaning not real traditional,
but kind of modern pro-.... Its very strange, but its not a ballet, its not a modern ballet,
but it is modern traditional dancing.
Thats kind of a funny way to say it, but there was a
dance group--it was kind of a noted group--so I asked her to participate and she was
very happy to do that.
So that was done while we had, Japan had the Olympics.
So after
that, um ..., Charlie Mariano realized that he couldnt really ... have enough activity in Japan, so
he wanted to come back to the States.
So we came back to the States at the end of 64.
It
could be 65.
I think end of 64, whatever it was.
So all that time from ... so I would say
a year in Japan.
My daughter was born in August, then it was the following year.
The
following year, I think maybe it was close to winter, possibly, because.... Now I think it
was close to winter--probably the end of 64--because I remember I knit her clothes in
yarn, so I think it was winter.
1115
 And when you came back to New York...?

 We settled in, uh, New Jersey.
And shortly after that, uh, Charlie Mariano and I were
separated for private reasons.
And uh, that ... then it was very difficult, a difficult life for
me started, because if youre a jazz player, you have to travel.
You cant stay in one
place.
And I couldnt travel because my daughter was three-and-a-half, three years,
three-and-a-half years old.
Lemme see: no, one ... one-and-a-half, yeah, one-and-a-half
years old.
So ... and I didnt have enough money to have a housekeeper, because....
Jazz players, its hard to get a babysitter, because New York--as I said before--you
worked from 10 to 4 in the morning.
And there is no babysitter who will come for that
particular hour.
So you really needed a live-in and I just didnt have that kind of, you
know, funds.
I didnt have the money.
So, til today I think the most important things,
you cant solve by money; but money can solve a lot of problems (chuckles).
1119
 (Chuckles)

 So unfortunately, that was ... so I think my daughter had a very, very difficult
childhood.
And then finally I decided, my immediate sister didnt have any children, and
she wanted to know if I would send her to ... send my daughter to her so she would....
And I then thought about it, and then I decided maybe I would send her.
Maybe
meanwhile, maybe I might be able to come to the point where I could get more jobs or
something.
But uh ... so she was in Japan til, uh ... first grade, beginning of first grade,
I think it was.
The beginning of her first grade, she was there.
Seven years old, it
probably was.
Yeah, three to seven years old.
But unfortunately I didnt ...
I didnt, uh
.. become like a household name.
Somehow, I mean, there were always some jobs, you
know.
I ...
I, meanwhile I had to like ... uh, I was hired to do some festival, and ... for
example, in the afternoon I was put into a trio with Elvin Jones, and then it was, uh,
Miroslav (Vitous) had just come from, uh....


1123
 Czechoslovakia.

 Yeah, Czechoslovakia, hed just come and there was this ...
I dont know how
that happened, but I was hired to do things like that.
But, you know, one job, it doesnt
really support...(laughs).
But somehow I always had a little job and (its) amazing to me
when I think about it: the fact is that somehow I paid the rent.
But it never came (to)
more than that.
And even though (chuckles)--this is, I think Im kind of, sort of like a
really simple-minded person--because it never occurred to me that I could go to Berklee
and teach.
It never even occurred to me.
And thats, a lot of people did, you know, go to
teach.
And a lot of musicians teach over here at schools, too.
But um ... (chuckles) so I
think Im pretty simple-minded, the fact that I, and its amazing, the fact that it never
even occurred to me (laughs).
1127
 Maybe it wasnt something you were interested in.

 Probably not.
And sometimes Japanese journalists, jazz journalists, said,
You could come back to Japan, and youd be a star!
" And that didnt even occur to me,
either, you know!
1131
 So I guess it was during this time then that you did play with Charles Mingus.
Is
that correct?

 Yes.
I was just playing solo at the ... the solo started as a ... actually, I was
going to have a day job, because, you know, children dont grow younger, they get older,
and need, uh ... need the funds to raise them.
And my prospects as a jazz player werent
that great, so I thought, "Well, I probably need a day job.
" So I paid $100 to init-- for a
computer programming school.
It was four months at a time, and I was in the middle of
it, so I had to wait for the time when they started a new one (term).
And, meanwhile, I
went to the Jazz Gallery, the Five Spot, you know, its in ... and there were Joe Termini and Iggy
Termini, who were the owners, brothers.
And Joe Termini came up to me and said, "Do you feel
like playing solo?
" And he said, "I just cant afford to have two bands anymore, two
groups anymore, and if you play solo maybe you can play intermission here.
" Thats
how I was saved and I didnt go to computer school.
1135
 (Chuckles) Thank goodness!

 (Chuckling) I think about it, I say, probably the Buddha said, "Dont go, Ill
get you some job.
" So this job, it was a long time.
Then when finally the Five Spot
closed, Art DLugoff of the Gate, Top of the Gate, you know, Village Gate, and Top of
the Gate was used most of the time was (for) trio jobs.
And so Art D'Lugoff said, "Come play at
my place," so I was playing solo there, also.
In those times, John Lewis used to come in


and I didnt even know John was there, you know, but he used to come in to, I dont
know, listen to ... well, he used to come in, but anyway....
So, when I was doing that,
Charles Mingus came to me and said, "Why dont you join my group?
" And uh ... before that, I
must mention about John Lewis, though, because this probably ... Im not quite sure, Im
kind of a little bit mixed up as far as that is concerned.
Charles Mingus asked me ... could be,
that could be first.... Um, "Why dont you join my group?
" And I said, "Why?
There
are so many good players," and he said, "Its true that there are a lot of good players, but
youre a new name," he said, "Youre a new name, and a new name is very important to
the group.
" Now, that really impressed me, because Charles Mingus, he couldve said to me,
Its good for you, youll get recognition," which I did.
Uh, "many people will notice
you," and like this.
He couldve said that to me, but he didn't.
You know, he was ...
many people, I think, disregard that part of Charles Mingus, you know.
They always ... its more
fun to talk about the other part of Charles Mingus (laughs), so probably thats what they always
talk about.
But he was like that.
So I joined the group and then was ... that was kind of
an interesting experience, the fact is, because ... for several reasons.
One--I think I
mentioned yesterday--he rehearsed, the rehearsal was at his apartment.
And uh, he
didnt have any music: he sang and we all had to learn that.
I think thats the best way.
But it was a small group, and so on.
And, when I joined, immediately we had (a gig at)
Peps in Philadelphia.
Peps was around the corner from the Showboat where I used to
play with a trio, but Peps was a bigger club, you know.
And ...
I think Pepper Adams
was playing; and uh, there was a trombone player--Im trying to think--it could be
Garnett Brown, I dont quite remember.
It could be Garnett Brown, I dont know.
But one point
.. when I first had joined, there was Booker Ervin.
I used to call him "Long John
Silver," because he looked like Robert Newton (laughs).
So ... and Richard Williams was
on trumpet.
So when we went there ... so we were there two weeks.
Two weeks ... the
front line changed, you know.
So the second week, <span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_1888_179">Charles Mingus</span> would say, "The next
weekend, Count Basie band comes, and we gotta, so we really have to rehearse.
" So we were
rehearsing many tunes, and so they came for a couple days, the weekend that Count Basie
band was there, and we ... he never played the ones we rehearsed (laughs).
1139
 (Laughs)

 It was really, kind of like that.
And uh ... then at some point, we were at the
Newport festival, but not in Newport, it was Cliff Manor, I think it was called.
Cliff, uh
.. it was more like a protest....
1143
 The alternate festival.

 Yes, it was a little ... out at that place.
I think it was something like that.
And
uh ... we also, there was twice--I have a picture--so we played at Newport up front, on
the main stage, but maybe another year, probably, we played the protest place.
But the
one that I have (chuckles), the one photo was I was playing the bass.
And he had a tune


called "Eat That Chicken," and its in A-flat.
And (sings), "eat that chicken, eat that
chicken, eat that chicken now," and he always played piano on that one.
He wanted me
to play the bass.
So (laughs), we were doing that and somebody took a photo and it was
at Newport.
So I remember that.
We did one year, one year we were playing the main
Newport, another year it was the other place, and I dont quite remember when was
when.
Somebody was writing a Charles Mingus book, and he kind of reminded me I was there
two different times with Charles Mingus.
So I guess hes probably accurate, I dont quite
remem--.
But at one point it was a quintet--this one for quite a long time was a
quintet--Larry, uh, Lonnie Hillyer Hillyer, I think, Hillyer....
1147
 Oh, Hillyer, yeah.

 ...uh, the ... uh, Charles McPherson.
1151
 Oh, Charles McPherson.

 Yes.
He was such a sweet man!
Hes the one and uh ... Charlie Charles McPherson.
So those two were the quintet.
And this one (Mingus) kept quite a long time as a quintet.
1155
 And of course, Dannie Richmond on drums?

 Hmm?
1159
 Dannie Richmond on drums?

 Dannie Richmond was, but ... see, those days, when you had a drug (arrest)
record, you couldnt play Philadelphia.
So Dannie Richmond couldnt play Philadelphia, he would
have somebody else, and ...
I dont quite remember who he had, but.... Charles Mingus and
Dannie Richmond were more like they were a couple: theyd go so well together, they
could change the rhythm pattern and so on together, and so.... And Dannie was a very
nice man.
He was a really nice man, and Lew Tabackin had some trips (with him) in Canada, a
couple times, together.
But he loved duck, and I cooked the duck here sometimes.
He a
really nice man, though, but that was Dannie Richmond.
I just uh ...
I couldnt stop
missing my music, so I quit.
1163
 So what year was that?
What, what time period?

 Im trying to think what year it was, because after I quit a white lady was the
pianist, but then Charles Mingus called me and wanted me to come back.
And maybe it was
because, he said, "I have a concert," you know, "I have a recording," I mean, "I have a
recording.
" And uh ... "So I want you to come back.
" And this was ... the first intention
was to record at the Five Spot, then it got ... it was a tuba player--I forgot his name, he


usually played at the Radio City Orchestra.
Um, I dont think he was a jazz player.
But
anyway, a tuba player.
Then, you know, the next thing, it gets bigger, bigger, bigger, and
the next thing you know its a Town Hall concert.
And you have everything: two drums,
two guitars, two pianos (chuckles).
Snooky Young was the lead trumpet player, and we
were rehearsing from 12 oclock.
And the music was not ready (chuckles)!
And it was
already four in the morning, back to the elevator going up, Snooky Young looked so insecure,
What is going to happen!
" you know (laughs).
That was the famous, famous....
1167
 Album ().

 Concert.
1171
 Sure.
So for the larger ensemble, how did Mingus, did he still recite all the parts
to everybody?
Or did he write any charts...?

 No, he never did.
1175
 Never did.

 But the Town Hall concert, yes.
Town Hall concert (October 12, 1962), it was
at the rehearsal, there was an arranger.
And I remember one arranger was (Gene Roland)
.. he used to play what they call "peck horn" (alto horn), and he wrote like it was
arranged for ... the Kenton band or something.
Anyway, he arranged, he did not write.
He said, "Thats not what I told him to ... orchestrate," he said, "Cost me $500 and he
doesnt come up (with it)," blah, blah, blah, and there were things like that.
But uh, it
was a really ... no music was prepared.
So when we were at the Town Hall (and it)
opened, there were copyists there--I dont know if youve heard from other people--
there were copyists in the middle of the stage.
And Charles Mingus said, "Well, this is a
recording session.
If anybody has heard its a concert, you should get your money back.
"
So everybody was trying to get their money back, and then the mob police had to come
out (chuckles), in the street.
And it was ... but Charles Mingus strongest point was he would, at
that particular spot, even if it was a concert, he would sing what to do.
You know, like
say, "Whap!
" so on, so on.
Hes playing and he said, "Whap!
" and he sang and that is
what the trumpet player had to do, and so on.
He came up at an instant, uh, phrase, he
would come up with something for the musicians to play.
And that was, he was at (his)
best.
It was really, you know, he was really a special ...
I think really special ...
probably you could call (him) a genius.
He was like, (in) an instant he could come up
with....
He could make music very exciting.
So ... thats something like a ...
I always
felt like his music reminded me of Mexican painting, you know: very colorful, very
strong.
1179
 Do you feel like you were influenced by...?


 Oh, definitely.
I think I was influenced by him quite a lot.
1183
 And did you have a good personal relationship with him?

 I like to think so, yes, yes.
Somebody tried to say, somebody said that
Charles Mingus, uh ... put the lid of the piano over my hand.
He never did that.
If he did that I
probably wouldnt have a hand (laughs).
You know, people come up with all kinds of
stupid lies.
He wasnt ... but he was very nasty to other players.
You know, sometimes
if he didnt like (something or someone), hed kick the drums and things like that
laughs).
So, he had two different personalities.
1187
 Maybe nowadays they would say he was bipolar.
But who knows?
I dont
know, but we know that he died from Lou Gehrigs disease.

 Oh, really?
I didnt know that.
1191
 Charles Mingus?

 Huh?
1195
 He died from Lou Gehrigs disease?

 Oh, Lou Gehrigs disease?
I didnt know.
You know, he used to have like a
big bump in the arm....
1199
 Oh.

 ... and he was in the hospital--uh, Mount Sinai--and I went to see him.
And
he was so big.
He was walking from there, so big that he looked almost feminine.
And
uh, uh ... it was some kind of lump, real big lump, and um....
1203
 On both arms?

 No, on one arm.
1207
 One arm.

 One arm.
I didnt know what it was....
When I had my very first Town Hall
concert)--first and only--that is, 67.
1956, when I came to this country--I think I
mentioned that--in 1966 I was, as I said, I was barely paying the rent, and 66, uh, New
Years ... the Japanese always think of New Years Day, you get introspective, you


know.
"What did I do?
Ive been in this country for ten years.
What did I do?
I didnt
do anything.
Maybe I will have a concert," you know, "maybe Ill have a concert;
maybe people might notice if I have a concert.
" So it took me a year to prepare,
basically, the funds.
And at that time someone asked me if I would do ... uh, the Holiday
Inn circuit, it was hotel lounges.
And uh ... so I ...
I went to this--I had to do an
audition--to this apartment and an old man was there and there was a piano.
And I
played and he said, "Oh, youre a jazz player!
" And I said, "I dont sing," so--those
places, of course, you sing--but I dont sing, so I dont know.
But he said, "Oh, its fine,
fine.
But you just have to play a lot of arpeggios!
" (laughs) Said, "You have to play that
arpeggio!
" So anyway, I got the job.
It was ... the greatest thing about the job, I was
getting $200 a week, but no overhead: hotel and food were paid (for).
And I didnt have
my apartment, I was still staying at a hotel here, so I didnt have that either.
So there was
no overhead.
And it was ... very soon I had about $3000 and I was.... Those days, a
house, you could buy a house for $15,000.
And it was six months later, I was thinking,
Gee, if I gig for another six months, I may be able to buy a house.
" But I didnt do that,
anyway (laughs).
1211
 (Laughs)

 I needed about $3000 those days to--isnt that something?
So cheap, you
cant think of it today--the Town Hall concert.
And that was a self-produced concert.
Then it took me a year to prepare.
And ... then, uh, that time the mayor was (John)
Lindsay, that was the mayor.
And for some reason, he named that particular day
October 7, 1967) as the "Jazz Day" of New York.
Now, that's my luck!
My God!
You
know, as I said, I prepared from a year before.
And about a couple months before,
whatever it is, and he said it its "Jazz (Day).
" So they had like a black-tie, invitation-
only kind of jazz concert at the Metropolitan (Museum of Art).
Then there was a free
concert at Central Park, things like that.
And ... (gasps) ... all the jazz critics, of course,
came to my concert.
And also Mingus came to my concert, with a camera.
I thought that
was a really, you know, great gesture.
And thanks to Little Little John Wilson, he wrote a really
good review.
But ... it didnt do anything!
It didnt do any good.
After that, I was still
barely paying the rent!
(laughs)
1215
 Did you have good attendance, though?

 I wont say that.
Maybe half?
Uh, because there was ...
I had to sell.... See,
this is interesting: I had a friend who used to with Martha Graham dance company, a
Japanese woman, and she said, "Well, you know, you can do it.
Its a little hard, but if
you just go to a Japanese company and bow, then they will buy tickets," and so on.
In
those days, there were not that many companies.
But I would have to go from one
company to another, they would buy five tickets here, three tickets here.
That took like
.. most of the companies, they only had offices only.
Not like today, you know; today


its like poo!--I can sell 250 tickets in one company (chuckles).
But it was like this, so I
had to go from ... 9 in the morning to 5, usually about three companies I could cover in a
day.
Then, from 4 oclock I would write.
And from ... almost six in the morning, I
would write.
I had five music (charts) to write, for the big band, that is.
So, that was like
.. probably that was the hardest, and uh ... when I finished the concert, I was like whew,
like really, because I dont think I could do that today (chuckles).
1219
 (Laughs) (Phone rings, plays Beethovens Fifth Symphony) I guess its a good
time to take a break!
I guess you really do love Beethoven!
So Toshiko-san, also
significant about the Town Hall concert is you meet Lew Tabackin, yes?

 (Inhales) Yes.
That, that was kind of funny in a sense, because I was looking
for a tenor player.
As I said before, I was preparing for the whole year.
Now ... uh,
Clark Terry had a big band in those days, and they used to play, uh ...
I think it was every
weekend, at the Half Note (which) used to be on Spring Street.
Half Note was Spring
Street.
There was a piano player, the pianist was Don Friedman.
But Don Friedman got some job
in Queens somewhere, it was some place where, kind of, long term or something.
So the
manager of Clarks band at that time, his name was Bob Messenger.
And he called me,
he said, "Well, Don Friedman cannot make it.
Can you sit in?
" So I was subbing, I said, "Well, it
may be interesting to read the music, but I havent read music for a long time.
" So, okay,
I went there.
And ... if you know the Half Note, the middle was the bar, a circular bar,
and the band was upstairs.
Now, the room was two, divided in two, one side and another
side.
Then when the big band went on the top, the rhythm section was on this side, the
horn players were kind of spread, so to speak.
So, I was there, and Clark Terry started with a
D-flat blues or something like that.
So I had to play (mumbles), then Clark Terry played
something, then it was, I heard a tenor player play, and it was, boy, that like knocked me
out!
It was an interesting combination: were talking about this, like 67, you know.
And
.. it had Lucky Thompsons family tree, which was very rare to hear in those days--I
guess it still is today.
But what he played was like a semi-cross between John Coltrane and
Sonny Rollins....
1223
 (Laughs)

 ...you know, a cross between that (mimics sound).
"Why that?
Who could
that be?
" (mimics sound again).
So, make the story short, that was Lew Tabackin, and thats the
first time I met him, and then I said, "I want to cop him for my concert.
" And he sorta
agreed, but ... there was, Thad (Jones) and Mel (Lew Tabackinis)s band had a swing tour in
California, and Lew Tabackin was asked to go.
I think it was, that time I think it was somebody
else who couldnt go or something, because Lew Tabackin wasnt really a member.
So of course,
naturally, three weeks against one job, he went there, so he didnt play my concert
laughs), he didnt play my concert.
But thats how I met him.
Then, uh, I would have
some, periodically I would have some jobs, for example, Hartford had a jazz society, and


they asked me to come and play, and with a horn player.
So that was the first time,
actually this was the first time we played together, quartet.
And ... so, Jake, he was, Jake
Hanna was living in New York at that time and he didnt have anything, so he said, "I
think Im gonna come listen to you.
" So he was coming with us, and Lew Tabackin was with
somebody else--you had to take a ... you have to drive there, so on.
So as I said, I didnt
know him, Id just met him, so I was kind of a little cocky, and I said (chuckles), I said,
you know, "Ill play trio for a few numbers, then I will announce you and Ill bring (you)
over, so you play," you know (laughs).
So, okay, so I played, then I (said), "Lew
Tabackin," and he played tenor--he really, he played a long solo.
He still does, but he
really ... what he played, it knocked me out!
Then he started taking (out) the flute, and I
said to myself, "Oh my God," because most great saxophone players play terrible flute.
So I thought, "Oh my God, Im going to hear some terrible, sad flute" (laughs).
1227
 (Laughs)

 They said it was "Willow Weep for Me," and it was like his ... as you know,
his flute, you know, hes got a beautiful sound....
1231
 Hes actually providing the soundtrack for your oral history right now!
(laughs)

 (Laughs) Its a beautiful sound, and that was a real surprise for me, I said,
Wow!
" So thats how I met (Lew) and we played together.
Since then, if I have
something, you know, a quartet situation, I always asked him, because he was free-lance
and also he was, he had one leg in the studio.
And he was with, uh ... Clark Terry
band.
And Clark Terry band, this was the one--I think they went somewhere, either
North Carolina or Georgia, one of those places--and they met at midnight at a bar, uh,
something Street, its moved up, uh, what do you call, famous, I think....
The bus
there, everybody took that, and they drove all night to get to one concert and then came
back.
I think there was very little money.
And uh ... those were the days.
You couldnt
do that today (laughs).
But I remember that he was usually with Clarks (band).
And I
used to be, became a regular sub; for example, Clark Terry had a job in Baron, Club Baron,
which was in Harlem--uh, it couldve been 130th and Lennox, it couldve been 135 and
Lennox, Im not quite sure--that was around there.
They used to have a place called
Smalls Paradise and I played there a couple times with Marianos quartet.
But this was
in) much later years and Clark Terry had a ... played at the Club Baron.
This was also, the
stage was upstairs, you know (chuckles), but whats interesting, those days, really,
because you see the same faces, you know, two, three times a week.
I think a drink was
somewhere like 80 cents or so, and there was no cover charge or anything.
And they
would tell you, said, "Well, you sound good tonight!
" or they said, "You sounded better
last night!
"
1235
 (Laughs)



 (Laughs) And it was like ... it was ... you cant, you dont have that today,
you know.
You dont have that kind of rapport.
First of all, going one time to a jazz club
today, you are looking at, two people, you are looking at close to $100.
So, things like
that ... its something that you go to listen to some group that you like, and one time.
You know, you dont keep going for two or three times.
You cant ... economically, its
not feasible.
So it was a very different scene in those days from today.
Anyways ...
when I started going with Lew Tabackin, and we decided to get married, at that time Lew Tabackin was
working with The Tonight Show band.
1239
 Yep.
That year was 1969?
That correct?

 Uh, 69, 70.
1243
 Okay.

 70, no, no, 70, 71, around then.
1247
 Thats when you got...?

 Because he had ... Doc Severinsen had a small band to go up, so he was a
member of that, had like six singers or something, that kind of thing.
And uh, and then
they moved to Los Angeles.
So that brought us to move to Los Angeles, 72, summer.
And, at that time I decided I was going to quit because I, because ...
I didnt really make
any impact, you know.
I tried hard, I had my concert, got a good review and everything,
but it didnt really change my life.
And uh ... so I decided maybe I should quit, because
the world doesnt need another piano player, you know (chuckles).
1251
 But, but, Toshiko-san, didnt you go to Japan again, for Expo 1970, before you
went to move to Los Angeles?

 Oh yes, the 1970 Expo (in saka), there was, the music director, the name was
Misa Watanabe, and <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_2158_1525726">Watanabe Productions</span>, very big production (company), and she ...
that (was) more like a real pops--you know, what Japanese call "talent" (tarento),
because television and blah, blah, blah kind of things.
She always said, "I respect (what)
you do, but its not, you know, not for my production.
" So when she was assigned to be
music director of the festival, and she called me up, she said, you know, "I can have you
for this," so this is good.
Thats how I was invited, for quartet.
And that time there was a
group (that) came from France, too, uh, Daniel Humair, I remember, he was the drummer
at that time, uh, came to Ja... saka, you know, World Fair.
And uh, I had Lew Tabackin, myself,
Mickey Roker, and Lew Tabackins very good friend called, um, Bob Daugherty, Bob Daugherty, Bob Daugherty ...
I will think (of
it) in a minute.

1255
 Bass?
On bass?

 Yes, bass.
1259
 Bob Cranshaw?

 No, no, hes very active, but this man is ... more or less stopped playing, uh, I
would think.
But, the four of us.
And we just went for ...
I dont think hes a very noted
person.
Um, I will ask Lew Tabackin.
1263
 Not Bob Hurst, though.

 Huh?
1267
 Bob Hurst?

 No, no.
1271
 Bobs too young.

 No, it isnt, no.
Bob Daugherty!
Bob Daugherty.
1275
 Bob Daugherty, uh huh, okay.

 Bob Daugherty , Bob Daugherty, and he was the one.
He was kind of a friend
of Lew Tabackin and so on.
So we were there just for the, that fair, world fair.
1279
 One event?

 No, I think we played maybe three days or something like that.
I dont quite
remember.
But it wasnt one ... but just in and out for that, we didnt have any tour or
anything.
So that was 70.
And ... that was the first time Lew Tabackin had been in Japan, and for
a very hot August, summer.
Very, very hot and very unpleasant.
1283
 (Chuckles)

 So, anyway.
So that was the first ... and then, as I said, it was 72, he ... and
uh....
I was, as I said, I was going to quit, I decided.
So I burned everything: my folder
for the PR, you know, things like that, they were union things.
I burned everything and I
decided....


1287
 (Incredulous) You said you burned everything?

 Yeah, so, I was going to quit.
So dah, dah, dah, so we left--you know, my
child, she was at the second grade by that time--anyway, we moved (in) July 72.
And
we were staying at Leonard Feather home til I found some, we found some apartment
or so on.
And uh, we found a house in nearby Burbank, where he had to go (to) work,
because he doesnt drive and I had to take him, so it had to be near Burbank....
1291
 Lew doesnt drive?

 No, he doesnt.
He doesnt drive, so Im the driver (laughs).
Anyway, then,
shortly after we moved, Jimmy Lyons, who was a producer at that time at the....
1295
 Monterey (Jazz Festival).

 Monterey, and he called me, said, "John Lewis wants you to be in part of a piano
playhouse.
" And uh, because John Lewis was the director at that time, the music
director.
And that kept me ... stopped me from ... quitting.
So I had a few times like
that before, because Joe Termini offered me (a job) to play solo, so this was ... John Lewis
offered me the playhouse.
That time it was Billy Taylor, John Lewis, and Erskine
Hawkins, and myself.
There was that ... and I, this was the first time I played Monterey.
Id never played Monterey before.
So that saved my career, so to speak, and John Lewis was....
So anyway, he was a very important person in my life, and I didnt know him then, not
much, but he used to come to--I think I mentioned before--when I was a soloist at the
Top of the Gate, he used to come around quite often.
But I just said "Hello," and thats
about all.
So I got to know him after that, and found out he loves wine and, you know,
and I collect wine.
So, he became a very good friend.
His wife Mirjana Lewis is an
accomplished, a very accomplished harpsichord player, and uh, also a wonderful cook.
So Lew Tabackin and I would go to their home, or they would come to our house, and so on, and
became very, very good friends.
But he was really ... little things like that kept me alive.
He used to say, he said, um, "When people identify with your music, you should always
play it.
You should always play it.
" And he said, "In my case, I think its Django.
"
Thats what he said.
So he said that he always played "Django.
" So, my case, it was
Long Yellow Road," I guess.
So ... in Japan, they always say, if I dont play that, some
fan will say, "I dont feel like I heard you," so they kinda expect me to play that.
So I
always play that.
Lew Tabackin calls it my signature tune.
But John Lewis was really helpful to me.
And one time he said, uh, "You know, why dont you write a tenor lead?
" cause he
played, when we were there he played a record, it was Coleman Hawkins playing the
lead.
I dont quite remember the music, though, tune, but....
So I had a couple of music
pieces) that were tenor leads, and uh, so that was a little bit different, you know, gives a
different color, so to speak.
So ...
I think I was also very much influenced by--because
when I used to listen to Modern Jazz Quartet, when it came out, first came out when I


was still in Japan--he was still playing standards.
The first one (The Quartet, Savoy MG
 had "All the Things You Are," things like that, it was very different, and nothing
like ... you know, I mentioned before, I was into Bud Powell, and this was like totally
different.
And it was so European and I felt like ... (sighs) "Maybe this man would like
to become a European.
"
1299
 (Chuckles)

 So ... after we became very good friends, Lew Tabackin and I had our twenty-fifth
anniversary, and I figured, "Well, we wont have a fiftieth anniversary, so maybe well
have a big party.
" So we had a party at the Essex House, and invited a few people, and
so on, and of course, John Lewis and his wife.
And on occasions like that, people make a
speech, you know.
And so John Lewis stood up and he said, "Toshiko infused, employed,
infused Japanese culture, so I dont have to do it.
" And he said that.
And then I, thats
when I realized, thats what hed been trying to do.
Because everybody knows jazz is a
fusion between European and African culture, born in this country, but he really wanted
to have more universality, I mean, more European culture into.... Of course, his wife
came from uh, the uh, now its gone ... uh, what do you call, separated in two....
1303
 Yugoslavia?

 Yugoslavia.
So things like that had a lot to do with it.
But also his music, you
know, he was ... more, becoming more, more and more like a universal (??
), so on.
I
realized my thinking was so shallow, and so....
He really um ... highly ... thought of me
as, some of the music that I have, like "Kogun," for example, or "Minamata".... You
know, he actually used "Kogun" as material, teaching material at Harvard when he was
teaching (in the) summer.
I have nothing but fond memories, and then I have ... today,
you know, I have, I like to have two sides: I still have, heavily, I have a lot of influence
from Bud Powell, I think I do--but I probably dont play like (as well as) him--but also I
have a lot of influence from John Lewis, the fact (is), I like to have both.
John Lewis was a very
economized player, meaning each note has meaning, has a heavy, heavy weight, a lot of
weight, and thats something I would like to be able to do.
So I like to have both sides.
So hes been a very good ... uh, teacher, in a sense, so.... Ive been very, I think lucky.
The fact is I came to this country when the music scene was still very open.
Not like
productions are like today, so you could sit in, if you know the tune, you could sit in, and
most of the tunes I knew.
So, thats the best lesson you can get, you know, playing with
great players.
And they were very nice to me and very supportive.
I came at a very good
time, and I think that is my asset.
1307
 Well, you brought up two very important, uh, uh, things that we should try to
discuss in more detail.
One is influence, you know, what you were saying is, looking at
cultural influences in music....



 Yes.
1311
 ...and then also looking at the formation of your first orchestra.
So....

 Oh?
1315
 Your first big band, the formation, the creation of your first big band.

 Yes.
1319
 How did that come about?
We know that you are now in Los Angeles....

 So, we moved to Los Angeles because of Lews job, in 72, summer.
And Los
Angeles had not much activity there.
You know, I remember Hampton Hawes used to,
we ... shortly after that, Hamp invited us to their home and his wife made a ...
I think I
never had a great taco like that in my life!
Anyway, so he was very, actually,
complaining a bit about the fact that the jazz clubs--for example, there was Dantes in
North Hollywood--but they were more like outlets for studio players, you know.
So he
was pretty much complaining the fact that they werent hiring real jazz players, whose
livelihood depended on playing.
And uh, that place was more like an outlet for studio
players, so that they could play a little bit or something like that.
So, not much (of a) jazz
scene.
Then Lew Tabackin found out, uh, he was asked, there was a union (that( had a rehearsal
room, and uh, he was asked to ... most of the time those rehearsals were done by the
writers who were trying to get into studios or movie thing or so on, to try out some of the
music.
I think thats what it was.
But ...
I forgot to mention the fact, after the Town Hall
concert, I felt very comfortable, I thought Id like to write for the big band because ...
I
could express more, then, because you have more color, so on.
But there wasnt any
place that--at that time the union in New York didnt have any room; today they do, but
they didnt--and uh, the rehearsal done by (for) this Town Hall concert, for example, the
cheapest place you could get was $30 an hour and you needed three hours and so on.
So,
once you start a band--I really thought, "I wish I could start a band"--but once you start,
you have to keep it, and I really didnt have that kind of money.
So that was that.
So
when we moved to Los Angeles, I wasnt, I had forgotten all about this, and then Lew Tabackin
came home one day and said, "I know you havent written but about five music
compositions)," which was for the Town Hall, and "Maybe Ill get the musicians, so
maybe well play your music," you know.
It was something to do; so he was very
frustrated with not much jazz scene, so I think he wanted to be close to that.
So ... those
days, 50 cents for two hours and 45 minutes at the union.
Now its $5.00 (chuckles).
1323
 (Chuckling) Fifty cents!


 But 50 cents, so I said, "Well, thats, we can afford it.
" Thats how it started
in 1973, spring.
And he got all the musicians, and it was a ... took about six months to
settle down.
Some musicians didnt want to put up with the music; some musicians, I
didnt think were appropriate, you know, so on, blah, blah, blah.
So thats how the band
started, not as a working band.
It was just to get together and so on, and I thought if I
could probably develop my repertoire and I was kind of getting my, more and more ...
its kind of hard to explain, because you dont really come to a conclusion overnight, you
know.
Sleep and then it was, "Yeah, thats what Im going to do," no.
But the many,
many years I kind of felt like I really wanted to express, maybe, a point of view, my point
of view, not just ... theres a tune and you improvise on (it), you know, having a good
time, nothing like that.
But thats--nothing wrong with it--but I wanted to ... my point
of view, for example, because Im very interested and Im very ... susceptible to social
issues.
Which is, most of the time, social conditions many times were dictated or geared
by government policy.
So, all those things have always been part of my interest, and I
wanted to ... see, Id like to think this one is, I think this way.
If I were a writer, I would
write in words, but because Im a jazz musician, so I like to spell it out in jazz music.
So,
I would start thinking like that, you know, and....
So when Lew Tabackin suggested we do that,
and then I thought this was a good opportunity for me to ... so meanwhile--this was
-Im sorry, 73.
And in 73 we started, and uh ... going every Wednesday morning
from 10:15 to.... And doing this, I accumulated a little at a time, the music and so on.
And they were coming, everyone ... and I started thinking, "Ive got to give them
something.
Theyre giving me, you know, to play my music," so I thought maybe Id....
I knew some recording producer in Japan--basically he was a classical recording
producer--but he was a good friend of mine.
So I wrote and said this was happening and
would he be interested in recording.
So he said he would be interested in recording.
So
in 1974, I think, Duke Ellington died.
1327
 Mm-hmm.

 And uh, after Duke Ellington died, broom-broom-broom....
1331
 Harry Carney died, everybody (chuckles).

 It was like following him, so to speak, like that.
And uh, Nat Hentoff had
written sort of a memoir or memories of Duke Ellington in, I think it was Village Voice, and uh,
when I read that and it.... You know, sometimes the little things have to be triggers and
he was talking about how Duke Ellington was, how proud Duke Ellington was of being a black American,
and his music (was) based on his race, a lot of em, you know: "Black Butterfly," what
have you, "Black and Beige (Tan) Fantasy," so on, blah, blah, blah.
And even (if) you
know it, still somebody said that.
And that triggered me to, I should look (at) my
heritage, cause um ... the normal belief in Japan was, to be Japanese and play jazz was a
handicap.
Thats the way, that was the normal thinking.
And uh, I was thinking, I said,


so when I read it I said, "Well, Im a jazz player; Ive been playing since I was sixteen
years old, and so on, blah, blah.
Im not a bad player, I have probably more experience
than a lot of young American players, but I have a different heritage.
" And uh, "I look at
my heritage as my asset rather than my handicap, and maybe I can bring something into
jazz tradition," which it was, Japanese culture never was part of that.
Maybe I could try
to infuse something; maybe that would be my job.
So, thats what triggered me, and at
the same time, there was a Japanese soldier was discovered in the Philippine jungle.
It
was nearly thirty years, he didnt know the war was ended.
In fact, I think he has written
a book--its a very interesting book.
But anyway--Lt. Onoda, Second Lieutenant Onoda
Hiro)--and I was writing for the flute piece.
I needed a flute piece for the recording.
And uh, and also at the same time, my father was a student of n play--I think I
mentioned that earlier--and he used to, also he was a student of tsuzumi, which is a
Japanese four-headed (drum).
And I always liked the sound, you know.
Actually, I like
all drums, I guess, but I really liked that sound, and I was thinking itd be really nice to
use that, you know.
So I thought Id like to use that, maybe it would be great with the
flute, and ... so I had a tape sent from Japan.
This was like a demonstration tape, a
demonstration tape for the tsuzumi playing.
And they have all kinds of ways of playing;
this was the Kanze (-ry) style of playing (chuckles).
1335
 (Chuckles)

 N players, you know, so they showed....
I took ...
It took me ... boy, ten
years to put them together in one segment, so that would be ... and it was music, fit to the
music, where they fall and so on.
And that was "Kogun," came as "Kogun.
" And when I
did that and we recorded this on eight-track....
1339
 A-track (chuckles).

 Eight-track.
Very low budget and eight-track, and in a place called Sage &
Sound Studio, in Hollywood, that was nearby (chuckles).
Anyway, uh ... when I wrote
this one and on the way through we did, I thought it was ... Japan, they were gonna put
me down, you know, they were really gonna.... Because Japanese jazz fans, they want,
more of purist (approach).
One, they like small groups--I dont blame them, I feel (the)
same way (chuckles).
And, two, they dont like, you know, theyre purists, they like ...
something like that--Japanese, you know, drums or what have you--"whats this?!
" you
know.
They, I thought they were really gonna put me down, and I thought, "Well, go
ahead and put me down.
I dont really care.
" So thats what I ... and that became an all-
time seller.
My records never sold (laughing) til that time!
1343
 (Chuckles)

 One and, this one was a big band!
One, two, thats something that no one had


ever done before, and no one ever heard something like that.
And both (were) against,
you know, sales, but it became (an) all-time seller.
The first sale was, I think, it was
000.
So, you know, jazz in those days, if you sold 5,000, it was considered good.
1347
 Still today (laughs).

 So (chuckles) ... so that was--and I was really surprised, wow!--so that was
my milestone.
1351
 1974, Kogun, mm-hmm.

 And I thought, "I wish Duke Ellington were alive.
I wonder what he would say?
" I was
thinking about that.
Duke Ellington was always very uh, ... grandeur.
He came a couple of times
to the (Berklee) school when I was at school, and I had a terrible cold.
And he would say
deep, elegant voice), "Oh, poor child.
My dear, I have to send you to my doctor.
"
1355
 (Chuckles)

 You know (chuckling), things like that, he was....
1359
 Well, a couple of things that have come up.
First of all, I just want to fill in
some details: where was the rehearsal facility that you used, in what part of L.A.?
Was it
in North Hollywood, or was it in Burbank, or...?

 Youre talking about in Los Angeles.
1363
 Yes.

 It was the union.
1367
 It was the union hall, okay.

 Union.
47, Local 47 union, and they had a rehearsal room.
And New York
didnt have it.
And as I said, it was 50 cents; today I think its $5.00.
1371
 But was it located downtown, or was it located where you were living?

 No, Vine Street.
1375
 Vine Street.
You know where it is?

 Uh, I guess thats North Hollywood.

1379
 You know where it is, okay.
So it hasnt changed, its still there, same place.

 Yes, same place.
Its still there.
1383
 Okay.
And, more importantly, um ... blending in the tsuzumi sound: did you
have any kind of harmonic or tonal considerations?
Or what was your thought process in
blending it into the jazz orchestra?

 No.
No, because they usually, fairly ... they dont have like a high-tone; but
they usually have a certain sound.
Theyre usually more or less the same.
They always
work in pairs: the one is ko-tsuzumi, small one....
1387
 On the shoulder, mm-hmm.

 ...which goes on the shoulder; and the big one goes on the hip....
1391
 -tsuzumi, mm-hmm.

 ...and oddly enough, the big ... small one makes a lower sound, the bigger
one makes the high sound.
And they always work together.
And I always liked the
sound, you know, so this was something that the first time I used.
And when, uh, I had
other ones, for example, "Minamata," for example, Kanze (Hisao)--we call it iemoto, the
one at the head of that particular style of n, you know, singing--hes deceased, but I
asked him to sing it for me, for this particular song, um, music.
So it was ... the tsuzumi
sound is pretty much the same, all things.
I think if you hear, maybe three or four
different n plays and if you hear that sound, its pretty much the same.
1395
 Yes, but you know--as probably you and I know, maybe some people who hear
this--in n drama, the tsuzumi players also have kakegoe (literally "hung voice"), right?
The vocalization: OOOooooh (mimics).

 Yes.
1399
 So that's what Im talking about.

 Oh, they make the great sounds to concentrate ... uh, the energy, then hit (the
drum).
And always the small tsuzumi player does that.
And the smallest, er, the biggest
one, they usually have a short, very short, low note sound.
They go (low voice) oooooh,
something like that.
But the one who makes the long, high-pitched (call), thats to
concentrate the energy, then they play.
The good players sound really, really nice on it.
They, uh ... have a Japanese paper, thats cut in a little bit, and they put that on the other


side (of the drum) to change the pitch the way they like, at the point where they like.
Thats what they do.
But as I always, you know.... Anyways, so that was my milestone.
1403
 So when you make the recording, but how can you tour this?
You have to take
these artists with you to tour, to tour, to recreate this piece when youre touring.

 I have a tape.
1407
 (Laughs) Ha!

 But twice we had real players, in Japan.
That was a luxury.
And also here at
the concert ... uh, uh ... the one time was at Carnegie Hall (recorded and released as
Carnegie Hall Concert by Columbia in 1991), and then another time at Sankei Hall in
Japan, they had a real player.
But most of the time, for example, we used to play every
Monday night at Birdland in New York, and every Monday night, and I had a tape
recorder set for that and prerecorded.
So, yeah, thats ... you know, if you are a classical
organization, you can afford to have, their budget will provide it, even though its like a
twenty-minute piece of music and all you need is one note (chuckles), they will, that
musician was hired.
We dont have that kind of luxury, so....
1411
 So now, Id presume that you look at 1974 as a ... this is now the land--, this is
the turning point in your career.
Do you now feel that you were successful as a jazz
musi-- did the success of Kogun...?

 I think I did (to) some degree, yes, I do.
I have--as far as music is
concerned--I have close to 100 pieces of composition.
And uh, the most important, to
me, I think, probably the important music compositions would be ... they all have
Japanese kind of ... herita--Japanese culture is weaved in.
And also one is Hiroshima:
Rising from the Abyss (2001), that one has a Korean flute player (Won Jang-hyun,
playing taegm), who was also employed, so it has....
But Ive always preferred ... Im
very careful, Ive always been very careful.
In other words, there are many music--
especially nowadays in Japan--said, well, put Japanese culture (in).
Somehow, its not,
in my mind, its not working in all respects.
When you use something that wasnt there
before, you have to be very careful: its like ... you still ... somebody listens to it and
says, "That is jazz music, but its a little bit different.
" You know, some different color.
I think its coloring: Japanese culture, you can only do coloring, not like some, like,
Brazilian music, you know, took over the jazz scene at one point.
But not like that, just
coloring.
But it is like, has to be ... for example, if you eat something, something that
doesnt belong, like a stone or whatever it is, and (gets) stuck in your throat, and it ... it
cant be like that.
Music has to be something without any uh ... problem, any um, ...
teik, um ... resistance ... it has to go natural, natural in the ear.
And just like something
unnatural in there, something there that doesnt belong there, its gonna (get) stuck.
And


it shouldnt be like that.
So, (you) have to be very, very careful, which is, I think I have
been very careful.
So there was Hiroshima, thats ... "Minamata" is.... "Minamata"
from Insights, 1976) actually ... uh, Down Beat, gained their album of the year, which
was very nice.
It was a long time ago.
1415
 Mm-hmm.

 Anyway, that and ... most things....
I have even, some of the things that are
very, very old-fashioned, its called "Relaxing at the Zell am See," not the Camarillo
laughs).
1419
 (Laughs)

 But um--Zell am See, which is a famous ski resort in uh, Switzerland, uh ...
no, Austria, excuse me, Austria.
1423
 Mm-hmm.

 And uh, it has real old-fashioned music, you know.
In the middle of it there is
a woodwind (passage) and theres uh ... tsuzumi, and it worked out very good.
You
know, there was ... Lew Tabackin said, "If you can swing that, Ill buy you dinner.
" So, he had to
buy dinner!
(laughs)
1427
 (Laughs) Well, sounds like you were, uh, very conscious, and even concerned,
about the audience reception your music, particularly in Japan, by integrating these
Japanese elements into your music.

 No, I wasnt concerned.
As I said, I felt like they were going to put me down.
1431
 Yeah.

 And I didnt really care.
1435
 Right.

 I said, "Go ahead.
"
1439
 What about your concept about how the American audience would receive your
music?

 How...?

1443
 Did you have any idea, or any concern about Americans receiving your music?

 Not really.
I ... of course, I hoped people would find, would identify with the
music.
Thats the way we get uh ... you know, reputation or highly regarded, or
whatever it is.
But, (the) main things to me always been--for my entire career, whole
career--it is, I have to be very, very true to me.
Im the first listener, as far as the
writings concerned.
Im the first listener.
So if this wont ...
I want to convey certain
.. some music is, as you know--"Kogun," too, but there was "Minamata" and
Hiroshima"--all those are like programmatic music, which Duke Ellington used to write, but not
that many, you know.
Uh, and that means you have a message: you have a story to tell.
And that message has to be in to the listener, the correct way, and in order to do that, Im
the first listener.
So I have to be able to identify with the music.
How (do) I do that?
Thats the way the work is, its from the back.
And ... main thing is always, I have to be
true to me, and hopefully people will identify with the music.
But if Im not true to my
music, Im not worthy.
I mean, all these years of playing, you know, all the work will be
wasted.
So I always think like that, you know.
1447
 Just like you say that Japanese jazz fans are more purist, they want to have
authentic jazz, right?
Coming from America.
They presume that jazz is an American
music, and the authentic music is from America?
Authentic jazz?

 Im not quite sure about (if) authentic is the right word.
I think they dont
really heard ... now that they dont, you know, they have great respect for me.
But the
point is, never done it before.
And they always ... the mainstream jazz fan is usually
interested in the individual players, which I agree.
I feel the same way.
And uh, so, but,
when youre writing for a large ensemble, theres an old way of saying, "A band is a
book is a book is a book.
" So its composition, which is not exactly how many ...
improvisation will be limited, and the whole compos-- it goes into a different category,
you know, I think.
And uh, but at the same time, it is like, player and writing, its like a
jockey and a horse.
Like <span class="fullMatch" id="match_409">Duke Ellington</span> never had a tenor solo til <span class="fullMatch" id="match_410">Ben Webster</span> joined the band,
so theres always, the great bands--like Count Basie was well known, it was (because of) Pres
Lester Young)--you know, always you have to have a great player.
Otherwise the
music doesnt have ... that highest ... uh, how do you say?
... high merit as music, jazz
music.
So there was a ... long time ago there was a discussion in Japan--I was still in
Japan--can you call (it) jazz if they have no improvisation at all, and it was all ensemble?
But its swing, its called....
But I think you can call it jazz, but at the same time, its not
very attractive, you know, its not very attractive.
Because if the improvisation is the
only merit of jazz, theres a lot of em, and all this.
You know, concerto of cadenza for
Isaac) Stern was improvised, everything like that.
So, there was a lot of those ...
European music has all that.
But as Duke Ellington says, you know, "it dont mean a thing if it
aint got that swing"....


1451
 (Chuckles)

 ...so thats a part of it, you know, thats the way....
1455
 Right.
Well, I think youre bringing up the issue that jazz is more than just any
one particular element or any one thing.
It is a lot of different things: its swing, its
blues, maybe a blues-base, its improvisation, many different things.
But I want to talk to
you because, when I listen to The Carnegie Hall Concert, 1991, the piece for the children
"Children of the Universe"), which is, I believe, Hiroshima....

 Oh yes.
1459
 ...I hear the way youre voicing the orchestra: its almost like the whole
orchestra is acting almost like, from gagaku (music of Japanese imperial court), you have
like the, what I consider severe portamento (sings), its almost like hichiriki (double-reed
bamboo flute) to me.

 Yes.
1463
 So....

 Hichiriki is a little different, but I know what you mean.
But "Children of the
Universe," that one, uh ... that ...
I kind of like that melody.
Its kind of like (sings)
teee-ah--ta, but ... that one is like, is probably more like explanatory.
First you start
with flute and tsuzumi.
So you hear very traditional Japanese, because Japanese think its
bending a note, you know, and uh ... and a tsuzumi player.
And you hear that, then when
the band comes in, the same melody, but uh ... they would have different ... uh ... cause
its harmony on top.
Its different, you hear different things: the melody is there, but you
know when it comes to the bridge, thats when the tempo starts and then the bridge, and
right there its just the old-fashioned jazz music, the ballad, like that.
1467
 Right.
But it sounds like youre mixing in--through phrasing, also some of the
chords, the way the chord, you know, sustained chords--to me sounds like sh (mouth
organ) and then like hichiriki.
Not really, exactly, to imitate, but use some of the idea of,
you know, the phrasing, so....

 Oh yes.
The first one was "Sumi-e."
1471
 Mm-hmm.

 That one I had written for the 67 concert ... you know, 1967 Town Hall
concert.
It was called "Sumi-e" and that was, I was writing in the middle--as I


mentioned before--from 12 oclock to 6 in the morning I was writing.
And uh ...
somehow I started hearing this gagaku sound and uh ... it took me quite an effort, but
that was played by trumpets.
Because I used to hear Japanese trumpet players bend a
note, you know.
And so thats whats typical Japanese gagaku sound: in other words,
two together, two together, like this.
And ... comes up top, while the melodys still
going, the same thing, now that was a very repetitious melody, keep going and third time
they have these things, weaving comes in.
And uh, I think it worked out well, but thats
the first time I did that, you know.
And when the first time with the band--Lew Tabackin got the
musicians together in the band in Los Angeles--first time we rehearsed, the trumpet
players were saying, "We cant bend the notes.
" I said, "Oh yes you can, because Ive
seen Japanese trumpet players do it, so if Japanese can do (it), you can do (it)"
chuckles).
1475
 Miles Davis did it all the time.

 But thats one of ... very first one.
But uh, the one ... um, the tribute to Duke
Ellington, that was commissioned by the Monterey (Jazz) Festival, 1999.
You were
there.
And the second movement, which is "Eulogy," it was, the start was the same
thing: gagaku.
And it was like that.
And it was ... when the tenor comes in, it was a real
ballad, in my mind.
Its like, almost like, "Whats happened?
" like this.
But it was, the
second time you play you get into....
So theres an introduction that seems to ... and
when you repeat theres something added, next time you repeat theres something added.
Something, and it comes to a certain point, and it comes to a very traditional ... whatever.
It takes ... takes a lot of effort, but uh, thats what the writers supposed to do, you know.
Im not writing for a jingle!
(chuckles)
1479
 (Chuckles)

 Im not facing a deadline.
So I always felt like Im fortunate to have the kind
of situation that I could take all the time in the world, so that I can always correct it if I
didnt think it was right.
That's the thing about the writing: you know, you playing and
you cant correct it.
I say, "Oh dear, why did I do that!
Its gone!
" (laughs)
1483
 (Laughs) You know, when I think of other artists, particularly composers and
musicians who are blending East, or Japanese, and Western concepts, I think of Tru
Takemitsu.
I dont know if youre familiar with....

 Yes, yes.
1487
 ...because he was already blending not only concepts--

 Yes, yes.

1491
 ...the way, the structure of the music--but also traditional Japanese instruments.

 We were very good friends, because he really liked jazz.
When he got the ...
fellowship from--I forget the name, it was a famous one and all--he said he wanted to
study with Duke Ellington, and they thought he was joking.
You know, I mean, its a
real snob, classical field, but....
1495
 I think Richard Stoltzman said this in an interview in Down Beat: that--I think it
was a Fulbright scholarship....

 Fulbright, yes, thats it.
1499
 ...in the late fifties--and they thought he was going to choose Copland, or, you
know, some other more classical composer, and he said no, Duke Ellington, and they just
.. and I think they withdrew it.

 No, I dont think John Coltrane was there at that time, yet, that time, I dont
think he was.
I dont think so.
1503
 Oh, I didnt say ... no, I didnt mean ...
I didnt say John Coltrane (chuckles),
no, no.

 Oh, oh, okay, sorry.
But anyway....
1507
 I said Aaron, Aaron Copland.

 Oh, yes, right.
Thats what they said and it was ... but he, he wanted to, so....
But his November Steps is the classic one and he liked to use the biwa (lute, similar to
Chinese pipa)....
1511
 And shakuhachi (bamboo flute).

 ...but he was such a sensitive writer.
He--I think we might have been the
same age, Im not quite sure (Takemitsu was born in 1930, ten months after Akiyoshi)--
he was a very frail person and drank quite a lot, so he had to be very careful about eating
and so on.
And he said, one time he said, "Well, why dont we write together?
"
1515
 Hmm!

 And I said (sheepishly), "Well, I dont know.
" I cant write what he does, and
he cant write what I do.
You know (chuckles), thats what I was thinking, but he was....


My unfortunate thing was the last time we were having a temper and I said--because he
was writing a lot of movie music--and uh, "Do you like writing movie music?
" and he
said, "Oh, yes!
" So ... one thing is I remember Kaidan, Japanese (movie) Kaidan
1964)--that changed the whole movie background music and he was kind of
revolutionary with things--but he started writing some for American, you know, movies
and so on, blah, blah, blah, but if he didnt do that, he wouldve done more ... music for
listening.
Its not what we call "cue writing," not that, but we would have more
Takemitsu music, you know, I think about (that).
But somebody said he really loved
movies, so it was kind of, it was natural that he wanted to write for movies.
But uh ...
hes one of the, I think, maybe one or two Japanese composers who actually comes down
to the, you know, level, the international level, as a contemporary writer.
Very, very
sensitive writer.
1519
 (Receives cue from recording engineer) Okay.
So, Toshiko-san, were talking a
lot about now, as composer....

 Yes.
1523
 ...I think that you have really changed, uh ... youve had an impact on the
vocabulary of jazz and tonal color, by bringing in the cultural elements from Japan.
Um,
but obviously you have a great regard and love for some of the people who came before
you, like in 1978, you made a recording dedicated to Billy Strayhorn (Tribute to Billy
Strayhorn, released in 1982 on Jazz America).

 Oh yes!
1527
 So, talk about, you know, Strayhorn, please.

 I think that was a trio, my playing on....
I think Billy Strayhorn is some-- ... his
music, I wish I could really digest well.
Somehow, his music had a more ... different, uh
.. dimension.
I mean, Duke Ellington was always a great writer, but his music is more, uh ...
suited with singing, maybe, to words, and so on.
But I think Dukes greatness was
probably orchestration.
(??
Track begins in mid-sentence with syllable ui , possibly
the Japanese term for sad, gloomy), you know, a Japanese, it has a ... its a more
different dimension; his music is something (that) has ... for example--let me thinking
about the things, you know.
The music would, say, "Isfahan" really sounds like there
Iran); and things like "Lush Life," where its ... "Daydream" is something that
Billy Strayhorn family, somehow they heard the record and they really liked the way I
played, so I tried to listen to what they liked about it.
Im only playing very short
laughs), I didnt realize I played so short.
Thats such a long time ago, you know, over
twenty some-odd years ago.
But his music was something that ... for example, Lew Tabackin
plays it really well.
I wish I could digest it really well.
Many of his music (pieces) let me


think about certain things, that particular music.
Its not hunky-dory, happy-happy, or
anything like that.
It was, of course, his last one, "Blood Count," it really sounds like a
blood count, you know.
Hes one of probably ...
I always thought he was like as great a
jazz writer as Monk, but Billy Strayhorn has ... one doesnt have to be a jazz musician to
appreciate or understand or, you know, the music.
For Monks music, you kind of have
to be a jazz connoisseur to appreciate his music, I think.
But Billy Strayhorn is music I
always ... liked and I wish I could--even now--I wish someday, I probably hope to
digest his music and do some justice to his music in my playing.
1531
 Well, obviously, as you said, the Strayhorn family saw some, saw your music,
your interpretation of Strayhorn as very, very valuable, so thats great.
You know, when
you were talking earlier about John Lewis and how he brought in a lot of, you know,
Western classical influence....

 Yes.
1535
 ...more, I know he loves Bach, you know, and very formal, very formalized, and
more Germanic tradition, whereas Strayhorn, also very much influenced by classical
music, coming more from the French tradition.

 But the difference is, I think, is that John Lewis was a player.
1539
 Mm-hmm.

 I think--I know Billy Strayhorn played the piano--but hes not noted as a player.
I
know he had a couple recordings, but John Lewis was a player.
Also, (whats) interesting
about John Lewis, his compositions are very European, but ... for example, like, say....
He has written a duet, as you know, with Hank Jones--he respected Hank Jones like
mad!
So although the duet was like traveling, or it has so much European influence; but
when he comes to solo, hes, everything is, his root has always been blues.
Thats what I
think, you know, so thats a very interesting combination.
I think thats one of the
reasons, maybe, when Bags quit--Milt Jackson quit at one point, one time he quit--and
he disbanded (Modern Jazz Quartet), someone, Im sure there were several critical
musicians or whoever who suggested to him, "Why dont you use this guy or that guy,"
you know, great vibraphone players, and so on, but John Lewis wouldnt hear of it.
But
because, I think, thats the way he believed, the way music has to be played.
So it is a
difference between he and Billy Strayhorn, in some respects, I think, you know, something like
that.
Of course, Johns music is something like, very clean (laughs)--transparent is not a
good word--its like, but crystal, kind of.
Billy Strayhorn music is darker, to me.
Its more,
like I said, multi-dimensional.
I wish I knew the right words, the right English words for
Johns music, you know, like a certain....


1543
 Why dont you say it in Japanese?
Maybe we can get somebody to translate it
later.
Go ahead.

 Yeah?
Uh, tmei ... tmeisei ... tmeisei (transparency, clearness, crystalline),
uh ... tsukitru (penetrating), tmeisei meaning tsukitru, its like something like ... its
like, uh (chuckles, frustrated).
I dont know how to say in English.
1547
 Its okay, well....

 Yes, tmeisei, sei is ... um ... thats what I think, Johns music, I always feel
that that has that quality, and.... Its pretty much like, thats the way he plays: he plays
very ... little (few) notes and to some degree its deliberate.
All notes weigh a lot, and I
think thats something that ... in Billy Strayhorn case, thats not his forte.
I wish ... for
example, like, I love <span class="fullMatch" id="match_439">Bud Powell</span>, as you know, and I know quite a lot of his music, but
his music is never that ... uh, its mostly, its bebop-oriented, harmonically a little bit
intricate, but its really instrumental music, rather than uh, ... like Billy Strayhorn music--
well, maybe its written on an instrument--but its not really instrumental music.
It is a
composition that is saying something, and thats the difference.
Uh ... hes really a rare,
rare, rare, great writer.
1551
 So maybe clarity?
Im not sure thats a good word.
But um, in thinking of, um
.. John Lewis and Billy Strayhorn, influence of European music, um--also the way you
talk, you know, as a composer, also as orchestrator and arranger--theres so many
different things (that) go into shaping the music.
Now, you have somebody like Gil
Evans, who mostly is known as orchestrator, arranger, rather than composer.

 Right.
1555
 Uh, could you talk about his music and/or influence, from Gil?

 No, Im not, I really didnt study his music much.
All I know is that he was,
before that he was writing for, I think it was a dance band, I forgot ... Claude Thornhill.
1559
 Claude Thornhill.

 And uh, but ... he knew Miles Davis.
I think thats what he has written, orchestrated
for the two (LPs), as you know, Sketches of Spain and others and so on.
But his whole
group--he had it for quite some time--but it didnt really have that kind of impact.
But I
think hes ... (hesitates) I hate to say this--all due respect--he needed Miles Davis to show his
full capabilities as an orchestrator, maybe, you know.
He was a very sensitive writer.
Hes not a ... one of the things I always missed, he was very sensitive, but he didnt have
a real dynamic thing, you know, and it was like, uh ... <span class="fullMatch" id="match_449">Duke Ellington</span> has it, Frank Foster music


has it, you know, a real kind of dynamo.
But he had written, I think, arranged,
orchestrated, I think it was strings, um, Bill Evans played?
Its beautifully orchestrated.
Things like that: he was a beautiful orchestrator, I think, very sensitive.
But ... Im not
.. also, this is, I just thought about something that.... Before Gil Evans came out, I think
European writers really couldnt get with it.
They couldnt identify (with) Dukes writing
and Frank Foster writing, what have you.
And Gil Evans, the way he orchestrated, European
writers, they could identify (with it): "Oh, I can do that.
" I think its a ... in that respect, I
think hes more like a bridge to the European writers.
Some of them came back here,
some American writers, with very European writing.
I dont know if I make sense.
1563
 Oh, no, absolutely.

 You know what I mean?
1567
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, I mean, uh.... We interviewed Hale Smith.
Do you know
Hale Smith?
Did you...?

 No, Im afraid not.
1571
 Oh.
Anyway, hes a classical composer, uh, African American, and he worked
with Eric Dolphy; he also worked with Mingus.
But, he said, yeah, well, Gil Evans, you
can trace the direct influence back to a European classical composition, just like the
Aranjuez, you know, the Concierto, certain things like that, theres already a European
precedent, he just kind of recasts it in a jazz language.
So its true, its a bridge, because
you see the original source, he just recasts it, so....

 Right, thats why I think that, so thats why now a lot of European writers start
writing and pretty much, some of the writers here, Ill say, "That sounds European"
chuckles).
You know, I think about that, something like that.
1575
 Well ... even somebody like who we were talking about--John Lewis and Billy
Strayhorn--but even ... you know, so we saw different ways of European classical
influence, you know, concert music influence.
But even Bud Powell wrote a through-
composed piece, "The Glass Enclosure.
" This is not a jazz piece (chuckles).

 No, but, it is not a European piece.
1579
 Right.....

 No.
1583
 ...but its through-composed (chuckles).


 (Calling to husband) Lew-chan!
Could you do me a favor?
Take the
champagne out from freezer and put it in the fridge.
I dont want them to freeze.
Sorry.
1587
 (Laughs) No problem.

 The ...
I think "Glass Enclosure"--one of my favorites, and Ive never played
it, I dont think I can play it--but I heard somebody play it.
But ... if you hear it, even
though no one, if I never heard the piece, and if I hear it, I can tell its Bud Powell.
I can tell its
Bud Powell, because....
1591
 How?

 ...its the punctuation, harmonize, also the way he ... you know, he has a very
unique way of punctuating things and always been a very, very muscular player, a real
dynamic player.
And his touch was like that: it was not a, you know, like Teddy Wilson
or somebody like that (chuckles).
He wasnt like that.
I dont consider that to be
European music, in my mind, no.
And also, it may not have the pulse like that, but every
once in a while theres a pulse, you know (sings).
Thats a pulse to me.
Thats like a, its
real ... but it doesnt sound like European music, in my mind.
1595
 Mm-hmm.

 But hes ... he wrote so many tunes, but I think they were, they were all very
good.
But its totally different from....
I think what a lot of bebop players have written
is totally different from something like a Strayhorn; bebop isnt a story, telling you
something, not that much.
Charlie Parker has written so many, but theyre riffs, so many,
you know, riffs, da-da-da-da, and so on.
So its not quite the same thing, I think.
1599
 Mm-hmm.
Well, it definitely shows some other influence other than strictly
through, uh, through jazz influence.
You know, again, its just getting ... like for
example, I want to ask you some other infl-- you know, you can like somebody; that
doesnt necessarily mean theyre going to influence what you do.

 I, you know, what I think is that as soon as we hear something you like, I think
you are influenced right there.
It may not be....
1603
 Conscious?

 ...obvious influence, but its not only music.
But I was very influenced by ...
there was a time when it was called "happening.
I guess the word happening, you know,
they are ... Robert uh, uh ...
Hamburger, you know, big hamburger (chuckles), those


days.
And by watching this, observing, if you have the money, you can put a quarter in
the box.
If you dont, you dont have to.
That kind of thing was going around there,
maybe at the time I was a student living in what they call Soho today.
Those days it
wasnt Soho (chuckles).
1607
 (Chuckles)

 Um, but Im very much influenced by things like that, Im sure.
And I like
painting.
I dont understand anything about it, but I like painting.
And by ... anything
that ... you look ... uh ... read, could be observing a social issue--even if it has nothing
to do with music--its a social issue, a political scene, you know, all those things if you
observe it, I think they all influence....
I, personally, I think I was influenced quite by
everything.
Other than that, if its not, I wouldnt be able to, I wouldnt be producing
things like Hiroshima: Rising from the Abyss, or "Minamata," or something like that.
Its
coming, maybe not (as) notes, but I ... the message and so on.
So everything I see, or
touch, observe, and if it gave me some kind of feeling, I was influenced right there by,
you know, different meaning, maybe.
1611
 Well, lets talk about your piece about Hiroshima, since you talked also about
how you have a political awareness, as well.
So this piece, when you were first
commissioned, you made comments that, that ... something to (the effect), "Why should
I write about this tragedy?
" Whats the connection?

 Yeah, youre talking about the Hiroshima piece.
Well, that was commissioned
by a priest--who was here not too long ago, in New York, with his son--but anyway,
hes a jazz fan.
He has quite many, hes very aware of my music that I have written, uh,
Minamata.
" Thats why he asked me.
It was 1999 and I was in the midst of writing for
the tribute to Duke Ellington and it was--excuse me, 1998--so I told him, "Im kind of
busy," and he said that he would wait, and he sent me a photo ... uh, (mumbles), its
somewhere here.
The photo was taken three days after the bomb was dropped, and, uh--
I mentioned earlier, think yesterday--that I was born and raised in old Manchuria, today
China.
And uh, I never had an air raid experience or anything like that, and then after we
came back to Japan, the whole family in 1946, I started playing immediately in the dance
hall.
And also, at that time, there wasnt much talk about this bomb dropped by the
Americans.
I think, probably, Japanese journalists and government and so on were very
sensitive about not writing things like that: we were, you know, right after the Occupation
time, so I think thats....
So it never even occurred to me.
And then later on, after I came
to this country, I heard news about some of the girls who were victims came here for
treatment (the so-called Hiroshima Maidens).
I heard all that.
But I didnt really think
much of it, to tell you the truth.
So when he gave me this photo, and I was so shocked,
because I had never seen anything like this.
So ...
I wasnt quite sure if I could write
something like this.
And first of all, we were looking at it--that was done in 46, 194--


...
1615
 The bombing?
45.

 ...1945, and here we are in, you know, 1998, and, first of all, when that bomb
was dropped, many, many people died, and horrible, horrible ... can you...?
First, does it
have any meaning writing music like that?
And uh, I didnt see much of a purpose in
writing music like that.
I didnt think I could write (it), and I was going to decline.
Then
I was just looking at a page and ... the one page that I missed, it was a young woman
who) was underground, so she wasnt affected, and she came out, and she just looked a
little bit, uh, and smiled a little bit.
And it was such a beautiful face--I know I have a
picture of her somewhere, Ill find it--anyway, uh, and then when I saw that, I said, "I
can write that.
" And it was, also ... even though the photographer who took this photo,
he also has written a series Full of Hope, you know, Face Full of Hope, and it was
definitely a beautiful photo.
I said, "I can write that.
" It was like, we have to have hope
no matter what.
Maybe, more reason you have to have, the more ... horrible the
situation, then you have to have more hope.
Like, uhhhh ... uhhhh ... Lama, great....
1619
 Dalai Lama?

 Dalai Lama.
He said, "Well we cant live without hope," which is very true.
And I thought, "Im going to make this more like a piece of anti-war, anti-nuclear
weapon, weapon-anything, and it was ... and we will not ... uh, give up hope that
someday maybe people will tolerate each other (chuckles slightly), and at least theres no
war.
And we keep saying that, we keep just saying that to the world, you know.
That's
the way I wanted to write, and I think thats, thats what I think I wrote.
So its a very
long piece, a 24-, 25-minute piece, and its just ... some of the war, and after the war,
these people with mothers were talking about their ... memories, so on, so on.
And the
very last part, and it was the hope.
This place was a short one, but to me this is the punch
line.
1623
 (Chuckles)

 I thought, "Well, this is a piece of hope, so Id like to play it in the 21st
century," and I said, I started writing in 1998, so.... And uh, so we did: 21st (century),
 August 6, in Hiroshima.
Then we had a little tour after that--maybe five or six
concerts--then came back to the United States, and then, of course, after thats 9/11.
I
still remember, that was a Tuesday morning, because we played Monday night, you
know, Monday night, always, and wed just come back from Japan, we had such a ...
I
had a terrible time trying to sleep and so on.
And uh, finally, I had kind of started
sleeping, then the phone rang, from my daughter.
And I heard Lew Tabackin say, "Really?!
Wow.
" And he went up and put the television on, and I said, "Oh my God, whats he


putting on the television for?
Im sleeping," and I looked, and then already, you know.
So, that was 9/11.
So after that, we always played at the very end of--Monday night, or
even if I play someplace else, it doesnt matter where it is--I always play that "Hope,"
that part, maybe about two minutes or so.
Very short.
So thats what we do in--thats
what I do (laughs)--any, uh, any situation.
No, I think ... you know, you were
mentioning before that, when you have many compositions, which one is your favorite.
People ask that, its just like uh, you were saying, its just asking somebody, "Which of
your children is your favorite?
" and it was....
But its something that probably ...
important compositions for me are probably "Kogun," "Minamata," and Hiroshima,
pieces like that.
And, I would like to think, "Children of the Universe," because that is
.. you know some-- ...
I dont even really listen to music and--jibun, you know, my
own--its a long time passed, maybe a couple of years or so on.
And then I listened to it.
And sometimes, even though at that time I thought it was good--thats why I recorded or
played it or so on--some music is ... gee, I dont know, I mean, uh, a little ... its not that
much impact, some music like that.
And then some music stands, and I think time is the
kind of judgment, judge of the music, I think, you know, the composition.
"Children of
the Universe," and then, I had written that one in 81, or 80, one of those years, and ... it
still stands okay today.
I listen to it.
So I feel very good about (it).
Many times when the
years pass, you know, twenty years later, and I say (sucks breath, sounds anxious), "I
dont know, this maybe ... a little too light-handed," or something like that, so....
I think
those ... all of them are very long (laughs), very long pieces.
1627
 (Laughs)

 Its getting longer and longer!
1631
 Well, the pieces you mentioned--as you stated earlier--you are a socially
conscious person, its reflected in the music, particularly in the titles you just said were
important to you.
(Takes deep breath) When I look at Duke Ellington, yes, as we talked
earlier, he was very much influenced by his cultural, uh, background.
But also, Duke
Ellington had a very strong spirituality, particularly in his later period.

 Oh, yes, of course.
1635
 So, for me that means humanity.
Uh, spirituality means humanity.

 Yes.
1639
 So I see that in your music, as well.
Do you feel that theres any kind of cultural
influence in this consciousness of yours?
You mentioned Buddha before; do you feel that
Japanese culture or maybe just your early upbringing has had an impact on the way you
view the world?


 I would like to, I would like to think it does.
I was mentioning earlier, that
anything you observe--it doesnt necessarily have to be music--but it could be anything
you observe and you felt something, right there you are influenced by (it).
So, that
includes everything: political scene, government, policymaking, and social issues, what
have you.
So I would like to think my music will have all that, you know, digested in
myself and comes out.
I would like to think that.
1643
 Well, I think your music speaks that, so....

 Thank you.
1647
 (Laughing) ...I think you got that covered!
Um ... also, uh ... let me take just a
quick break, just a minute.
Um, here in 2008, its a very interesting year for America: we
have a woman running for president....

 Oh, president, yes.
1651
 ...and a black man.
And when I think about your career--again, my mothers
Japanese--I think about her experience.
I know her experience directly, coming to
America, being Japanese, in the aftermath of World War II, where Japanese people
were) viewed as the enemy--even Japanese Americans, viewed as the enemy, because
they were put in the (relocation) camps.
So Im wondering: you come as a Japanese
person and woman.
Do you, how do you ... when you reflect back, look back--cause
lot of times you dont recognize it when its happening--do you feel that that worked
against you?
Obviously, in some ways, it worked in your favor, like you said you got the
scholarship from Berklee cause they could advertise, they used you for advertising.
Do
you feel that these, that you being a woman and Japanese worked against you in
America, whether its just being a jazz musician, or just the way you were treated
socially?

 I think, uh, you know, I never thought about it til, uh, this woman issue came
out--I think it was (Germaine) Greer or someone like that from, uh, England--that
started this feminist blah, blah, blah.
I never really thought about being Japanese as ... a
handicap or as a ... so on, til ... there was a newspaper in Boston.
I was getting a lot of
attention: I was getting a Mademoiselle award (in January 1958) or things like that, or
became an ASCAP member.
And uh, the journalist who was writing, he wrote--I dont
quite remember the exact words of that one--but basically what he was saying was,
Why is she getting all this attention?
A lot of good Bostonian jazz players, theyre not
getting any limelight," or things like that.
So, I thought about, well, we have a saying, it
says: "stick out nail will be beaten" (laughs), so I guess thats what it is!
You know, and
track begins in mid-sentence) it was a big band.
It was just the first time when ...
I think


was seventy-, say sixty--I think it was 74, uh, September.
Thats what I think.
It was a
Friday night and there was a lot of attention.
And it was some paper--Im not quite sure,
I dont remember which paper, San Francisco or Los Angeles paper--but the paper, it
said, "I question her authenticity.
" That was, that was ... so, there were things like that:
its obviously because shes Japanese," you know, "its not authentic.
" But thats why,
when in 2007 I received the NEA Jazz Master and you have to make a little speech, and I
mentioned the fact that I came a long way from being written ... about "question her
authenticity," to what is the highest honor of a jazz player.
Because I think sometimes it
gets that kind of things because its ... we also have a saying: "a little bump above the
eyes can annoy" (laughs).
So it, like, annoys some people to get (??).
But if youre a
pioneer--I guess I am a pioneer, I think....
1655
 Mm-hmm!

 ...you get all the heat.
But that comes with it, so you have to accept, you
know, everything.
Thats the way I think.
I was ... there was a lot of those ...
I decided
to have a very simple rule that I decided to have for myself.
It is, one, if I have no control
over what somebody else will say something, or like, say "Oh, shes Japanese," or Im
Japanese, I have no control (over that), Im a woman, Im a jazz musician, you know.
But I wont worry about it if I have no control.
But if I have control over (it), and then if
its, I dont like it, I correct (it).
You know, those two things.
So, if I have no control
over (it), I decided not to worry about (it).
But at the same time, that sounds so
wonderful and easy (laughs).
1659
 (Laughs) Well, there is ... (laughs harder) ... well, theres always, since we are
in America, and we are dealing with music, theres always the business side of things.
And that ... and during the course of this interview, youve talked about the challenges of
dealing with the business of this music.
And nowadays, were in the midst of this huge
change from the analog to digital and the internet, and many of the landmark recordings
youve produced are no longer available, or at least conspicuous in the marketplace.
So
obviously the business is something youve had to negotiate.
How do you feel--do you
feel you were successful in dealing the business, and if not, what would you change?

 I dont do that.
I dont do that, because Im not capable.
So I just, uh, if
anybody were interested, they probably will offer something.
It its not, thats the way it
is.
I can only do what I can do, which is to try to do my best to write music or play better
than yesterday.
It may not be always that way, but at least I can try, you know.
Thats all
I can do.
And that gives me full time, you know, every day.
Its full time for me, so....
1663
 So once you become--this is what I learned from Red Callender--if you
become a musician, he said, youre al--... you know Red Callender, right?
Thats
Charles Mingus teacher, so uh....



 What?
1667
 Charles Mingus teacher.
He said, "If you become a musician," he said, talking
to me, "you will always be a student.
You will never be a master.
" You believe this?

 Oh yes.
Yes.
I think you try.
All you can do is try.
Because there are always
.. if you did something that you really wanted to correct, or achieve something, as soon
as you achieve that, theres another one in front of you.
Never, you know, um, fortunate.
But I think thats good.
Its ...
I feel sometimes fortunate that way that Im a musician,
because theres always something to do.
1671
 Well, Toshiko, during the course of this interview youve talked about this
career, this amazing career of yours.
Youre, you know--as you say yourself--a pioneer.
You had overcome so many things, whether its cultural, whether its musical, or
whatever, um, but yet youve succeeded, you know.

 (Laughs modestly)
1675
 And the way to measure that is your own, what you feel is your own success.
And also you have been recognized: the Nanri award, you said, was the first award, and
when you had your big band in Los Angeles, you got many Grammy nominations....

 (Laughs modestly)
1679
 ...so what were the other awards that meant something to you?

 I think it probably meant something ... all awards mean something, because,
as you know, music is not a sport: theres no such thing as number one or number two.
But when you have an award or you have certain things, its because they are paying
attention to what you do.
At the same time, if they dont like you, theyre not going to
vote for you.
So theres some love involved; so you are loved by many people, so on,
and you are pay ... people pay attention to your ... what you do.
That's where the value
lies.
So I have ... all awards mean a lot.
But, I must say, for me, its the Master, Jazz
Master, because that comes from America, which is ... Im not an American citizen, and,
as I said, it came a long time, a long way from being written "not authentic" or what have
you (laughs).
So (for) jazz musicians, its an achievement getting National Endowment
for the) Arts to ... by recognize and given a fellowship, Jazz Master Fellowship, I think
thats about the highest I can ... you know.
I really, uh, when that phone rang--it usually
comes earlier and they say that you shouldnt talk til the official announcement and so
on--but when they said it, I thought, "Is this confirmed?
" First of all I said, "Is it
confirmed?
" and she said, "Yes, its (confirmed), congratulations," and blah, blah, blah.

And then, because ...
I have a ... Lew Tabackin always said--and often I mentioned at the
Birdland, you know, thing--Lew Tabackin always said I am "demographically challenged"
laughs).
1683
 (Laughs)

 So I didnt really think I could get things like that, so ...
I think thats about
the highest, you know.
Im very, very grateful.
I think thats ...
I have to be, I dont
know if I am worthy.
I have to ...
I can try (laughs).
1687
 (Laughs) Well, I think, because you received the award, the jazz world knows
that youre worthy.
And so, Toshiko--unless you have anything else you want to add to
this interview--I just want to say, on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award, just want to thank you so much for
allowing us to come into your house to document your life for the historical record.
Um,
we hope that this will be shared with many future generations to come, so they
understand that a woman from Japan can come to America and become a master of
American music.

 Thank you very much for asking.
Thank you.
1691
 Thank you so much.
Domo arigat gozaimashita.

 D itashimashite.
